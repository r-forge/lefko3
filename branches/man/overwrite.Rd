}
\arguments{
\item{stage3}{The name of the stage in occasion \emph{t}+1 in the transition
to be replaced.}

\item{stage2}{The name of the stage in occasion \emph{t} in the transition to
be replaced.}

\item{stage1}{The name of the stage in occasion \emph{t}-1 in the transition
to be replaced. Only needed if a historical matrix is to be produced. Use
\code{rep} if all reproductive stages are to be used, and leave empty or use
\code{all} if all stages in stageframe are to be used.}

\item{eststage3}{The name of the stage to replace \code{stage3}. Only needed
if a transition will be replaced by another estimated transition.}

\item{eststage2}{The name of the stage to replace \code{stage2}. Only needed
if a transition will be replaced by another estimated transition.}

\item{eststage1}{The name of the stage to replace \code{stage1}. Only needed
if a transition will be replaced by another estimated transition, and the
matrix to be estimated is historical.}

\item{givenrate}{A fixed rate or probability to replace for the transition
described by \code{stage3}, \code{stage2}, and \code{stage1}.}

\item{type}{A vector denoting the kind of transition between occasions
\emph{t} and \emph{t}+1 to be replaced. This should be entered as \code{1},
\code{S}, or \code{s} for the replacement of a survival transition; or
\code{2}, \code{F}, or \code{f} for the replacement of a fecundity
transition. If empty or not provided, then defaults to \code{1} for survival
transition.}

\item{type_t12}{An optional vector denoting the kind of transition between
occasions \emph{t}-1 and \emph{t}. Only necessary if a historical MPM in
deVries format is desired. This should be entered as \code{1}, \code{S}, or
\code{s} for a survival transition; or \code{2}, \code{F}, or \code{f} for a
fecundity transitions. Defaults to \code{1} for survival transition, with
impacts only on the construction of deVries-format hMPMs.}
}
\value{
A data frame that puts the above vectors together and can be used as
input in \code{\link{flefko3}()}, \code{\link{flefko2}()},
\code{\link{rlefko3}()},\code{\link{rlefko2}()}, and
\code{\link{aflefko2}()}.

Variables in this data frame include the following:
\item{stage3}{Stage at occasion \emph{t}+1 in the transition to be replaced.}
\item{stage2}{Stage at occasion \emph{t} in the transition to be replaced.}
\item{stage1}{Stage at occasion \emph{t}-1 in the transition to be replaced.}
\item{eststage3}{Stage at occasion \emph{t}+1 in the transition to replace
the transition designated by \code{stage3}, \code{stage2}, and \code{stage1}.}
\item{eststage2}{Stage at occasion \emph{t} in the transition to replace the
transition designated by \code{stage3}, \code{stage2}, and \code{stage1}.}
\item{eststage1}{Stage at occasion \emph{t}-1 in the transition to replace
the transition designated by \code{stage3}, \code{stage2}, and \code{stage1}.}
\item{givenrate}{A constant to be used as the value of the transition.}
\item{convtype}{Designates whether the transition from occasion \emph{t} to
occasion \emph{t}+1 is a survival-transition probability (1) or a fecundity
rate (2).}
\item{convtype_t12}{Designates whether the transition from occasion
\emph{t}-1 to occasion \emph{t} is a survival transition probability (1), a
fecundity rate (2).}

\description{
\code{overwrite()} returns a data frame describing which particular
transitions within an ahistorical or historical projection matrix to
overwrite with either given rates and probabilities, or other estimated
transitions.
