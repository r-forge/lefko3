#' the entire individual, if \code{singlecensor = TRUE}.
#' @param repstrrel This is a scalar multiplier on variable \code{repstrbcol} to
#' make it equivalent to \code{repstracol}. This can be useful if two 
#' reproductive status variables have related but unequal units, for example if
#' \code{repstracol} refers to one-flowered stems while \code{repstrbcol} refers
#' to two-flowered stems. Defaults to \code{1}.
#' @param fecrel This is a scalar multiplier on variable \code{fecbcol} to make

#' being operationalized. Note that if \code{stagecol} is provided, then this
#' stageframe is not used for stage designation.
#' @param stagesize A variable name or column number describing which size 
#' variable to use in stage estimation. Defaults to NA, and can also take 
#' \code{sizea}, \code{sizeb}, \code{sizec}, \code{sizeab}, \code{sizebc},
#' \code{sizeac}, \code{sizeabc}, or \code{sizeadded}, depending on
#' which size variable within the input dataset is chosen. Note that the
#' variable(s) chosen should be presented in the order of the primary,

#' \code{stageassign}. For example, choosing \code{sizeb} assumes that this size
#' is the primary variable in the stageframe.
#' @param censorkeep The value of the censor variable identifying data to be
#' included in analysis. Defaults to \code{0}, but may take any value including
#' \code{NA}. Note that if \code{NA} is the value to keep, then this function
#' will alter all \code{NA}s to \code{0} values, and all other values to
#' \code{1}, treating \code{0} as the new value to keep.
#' @param censorRepeat A logical value indicating whether the censor variable
#' is a single column, or whether it repeats across occasion blocks. Defaults to

#' estimation is desired and X and Y coordinates are supplied. Given in the same
#' units as those used in the X and Y coordinates given in \code{xcol} and 
#' \code{ycol}. Defaults to \code{NA}.
#' @param NAas0 If \code{TRUE}, then all \code{NA} entries for size and
#' fecundity variables will be set to 0. This can help increase the sample size
#' analyzed by \code{\link{modelsearch}()}, but should only be used when it is
#' clear that this substitution is biologically realistic. Defaults to
#' \code{FALSE}.
#' @param NRasRep If \code{TRUE}, then will treat non-reproductive but mature 
#' individuals as reproductive during stage assignment. This can be useful when
#' a MPM is desired without separation of reproductive and non-reproductive but
#' mature stages of the same size. Only used if \code{stageassign} is set to a
#' stageframe. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param NOasObs If \code{TRUE}, then will treat individuals that are
#' interpreted as not observed in the dataset as though they were observed
#' during stage assignment. This can be useful when a MPM is desired without
#' separation of observable and unobservable stages. Only used if
#' \code{stageassign} is set to a stageframe. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param prebreeding A logical term indicating whether the life history model
#' is pre-breeding. If so, then \code{1} is added to all ages. Defaults to

#' living status at occasion \emph{t}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case
#' data for occasions in which the individual is not alive in time \emph{t} is
#' not retained. This option should be kept \code{FALSE}, except to inspect
#' potential errors in the dataset.
#' @param quiet A logical variable indicating whether to silence warnings.
#' Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' 
#' @return If all inputs are properly formatted, then this function will output
#' a historical vertical data frame (class \code{hfvdata}), meaning that the
#' output data frame will have three consecutive occasions of size and
#' reproductive data per individual per row. This data frame is in standard

#' @section Notes:
#' In some datasets on species with unobservable stages, observation status
#' (\code{obsstatus}) might not be inferred properly if a single size variable
#' is used that does not yield sizes greater than 0 in all cases in which
#' individuals were observed. Such situations may arise, for example, in plants
#' when leaf number is the dominant size variable used, but individuals
#' occasionally occur with inflorescences but no leaves. In this instances,
#' it helps to mark related variables as \code{sizeb} and \code{sizec}, because
#' observation status will be interpreted in relation to all 3 size variables.
#' Further analysis can then utilize only a single size variable, of the user's
#' choosing. Similar issues can arise in reproductive status (\code{repstatus}).
#' 
#' Juvenile designation should only be used when juveniles fall outside of the
#' size classification scheme used in determining stages. If juveniles are to be
#' size classified along the size spectrum that adults also fall on, then
#' it is best to treat juveniles as mature but not reproductive.
#' 
#' Warnings that some individuals occur in state combinations that do not match
#' any stages in the stageframe used to assign stages are common when first
#' working with a dataset. Typically, these situations can be identified as
#' \code{NoMatch} entries in \code{stage3}, although such entries may crop up in
#' \code{stage1} and \code{stage2}, as well. In rare cases, these warnings will
#' arise with no concurrent \code{NoMatch} entries, which indicates that the
#' input dataset contained conflicting state data at once suggesting that the
#' individual is in some stage but is also dead. The latter is removed if the
#' conflict occurs in occasion \emph{t} or \emph{t}-1, as only living entries
#' are allowed in time \emph{t} and time \emph{t}-1 may involve living entries
#' as well as non-living entries immediately prior to birth.
#' 
#' Care should be taken to avoid variables with negative values indicating size,
#' fecundity, or reproductive or observation status. Negative values can be
#' interpreted in different ways, typically reflecting estimation through other
#' algorithms rather than actual measured data. Variables holding negative
#' values can conflict with data management algorithms in ways that are
#' difficult to predict.
#' 
#' Unusual errors (e.g. \code{"Error in .pfj..."}) may occur in cases where the
#' variables are improperly passed, where seemingly numeric variables include
#' text, or where the \code{blocksize} is improperly set.
#' 
#' Density estimation is performed as a count of individuals alive and within
#' the radius specified in \code{spacing} of the respective individual at some
#' point in time.
#' 
#' If a censor variable is included for each monitoring occasion, and the
#' \code{blocksize} option is set, then the user must set
#' \code{censorRepeat = TRUE} in order to censor the correct transitions.
#' Failing this step will likely lead to the loss of a large portion of the data
#' as all data for entire individuals will be excluded.

#' @param juv2col A variable name or column number that marks individuals in
#' immature stages in occasion \emph{t}. Function \code{historicalize3()}
#' assumes that immature individuals are identified in this variable marked with
#' a number equal to or greater than \code{1}, and that mature individuals are
#' marked as \code{0} or \code{NA}.
#' @param juv3col A variable name or column number that marks individuals in
#' immature stages in occasion \emph{t}+1. Function \code{historicalize3()}
#' assumes that immature individuals are identified in this variable marked with
#' a number equal to or greater than \code{1}, and that mature individuals are
#' marked as \code{0} or \code{NA}.
#' @param stageassign The stageframe object identifying the life history model
#' being operationalized. Note that if \code{stage2col} is provided, then this
#' stageframe is not utilized in stage designation.
#' @param stagesize A variable name or column number describing which size 
#' variable to use in stage estimation. Defaults to \code{NA}, and can also take 
#' \code{sizea}, \code{sizeb}, \code{sizec}, \code{sizeab}, \code{sizebc},
#' \code{sizeac}, \code{sizeabc}, or \code{sizeadded}, depending on
#' which size variable within the input dataset is chosen. Note that the
#' variable(s) chosen should be presented in the order of the primary,
#' secondary, and tertiary variables in the stageframe input with
#' \code{stageassign}. For example, choosing \code{sizeb} assumes that this size
#' variable in the dataset is the primary variable in the stageframe.
#' @param censor A logical variable determining whether the output data should
#' be censored using the variable defined in \code{censorcol}. Defaults to 
#' \code{FALSE}.
#' @param censorcol A variable name or column number corresponding to a censor
#' variable within the dataset, used to distinguish between entries to use and
#' those to discard from analysis, or to designate entries with special issues 
#' that require further attention.
#' @param censorkeep The value of the censoring variable identifying data that
#' should be included in analysis. Defaults to \code{0}, but may take any value
#' including \code{NA}.
#' @param spacing The spacing at which density should be estimated, if density
#' estimation is desired and X and Y coordinates are supplied. Given in the same
#' units as those used in the X and Y coordinates given in \code{xcol} and
#' \code{ycol}. Defaults to \code{NA}.
#' @param NAas0 If TRUE, then all \code{NA} entries for size and fecundity
#' variables will be set to \code{0}. This can help increase the sample size
#' analyzed by  \code{\link{modelsearch}()}, but should only be used when it is
#' clear that this substitution is biologically realistic. Defaults to
#' \code{FALSE}.
#' @param NRasRep If set to \code{TRUE}, then this function will treat
#' non-reproductive but mature individuals as reproductive during stage
#' assignment. This can be useful when a matrix is desired without separation of
#' reproductive and non-reproductive but mature stages of the same size. Only
#' used if \code{stageassign} is set to a valid stageframe. Defaults to
#' \code{FALSE}.
#' @param NOasObs If \code{TRUE}, then will treat individuals that are
#' interpreted as not observed in the dataset as though they were observed
#' during stage assignment. This can be useful when a MPM is desired without
#' separation of observable and unobservable stages. Only used if
#' \code{stageassign} is set to a stageframe. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param prebreeding A logical term indicating whether the life history model
#' is pre-breeding. If so, then \code{1} is added to all ages. Defaults to
#' \code{TRUE}.
#' @param age_offset A number to add automatically to all values of age at time
#' \emph{t}. Defaults to \code{0}.
#' @param reduce A logical variable determining whether unused variables and
#' some invariant state variables should be removed from the output dataset.
#' Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param a2check A logical variable indicating whether to retain all data with
#' living status at occasion \emph{t}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case
#' data for occasions in which the individual is not alive in time \emph{t} is
#' not retained. This option should be kept \code{FALSE}, except to inspect
#' potential errors in the dataset.
#' @param quiet A logical variable indicating whether to silence warnings.
#' Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' 
#' @return If all inputs are properly formatted, then this function will output
#' a historical vertical data frame (class \code{hfvdata}), meaning that the
#' output data frame will have three consecutive years of size and reproductive
#' data per individual per row. This data frame is in standard format for all
#' functions used in \code{lefko3}, and so can be used without further 
#' modification. Note that determination of state in occasions \emph{t}-1 and
#' \emph{t}+1 gives preference to condition in occasion \emph{t} within the
#' input dataset. Conflicts in condition in input datasets that have both
#' occasions \emph{t} and \emph{t}+1 listed per row are resolved by using
#' condition in occasion \emph{t}.

#' @section Notes:
#' Warnings that some individuals occur in state combinations that do not match
#' any stages in the stageframe used to assign stages, and that some individuals
#' match characteristics of several stages in the stageframe, are common when
#' first working with a dataset. Typically, these situations can be identified as
#' \code{NoMatch} entries in \code{stage3}, although such entries may crop up in
#' \code{stage1} and \code{stage2}, as well. In some cases, these warnings will
#' arise with no concurrent \code{NoMatch} entries. These are important warnings
#' and suggest that there is likely a problem with the stageframe. The most
#' common such problems are: 1) stages have significant overlap in
#' characteristics, with the most common being overlapping size bins caused by
#' erroneous definitions of size bin halfwidths; and 2) some individuals exist
#' in states not defined within the stageframe.
#' 
#' In some datasets with unobservable stages, observation status
#' (\code{obsstatus}) might not be inferred properly if a single size variable
#' is used that does not yield sizes greater than 0 in all cases in which
#' individuals were observed. Such situations may arise, for example, in plants
#' when leaf number is the dominant size variable used, but individuals
#' occasionally occur with inflorescences but no leaves. In this instances,
#' it helps to mark related variables as \code{sizeb} and \code{sizec}, because
#' observation status will be interpreted in relation to all 3 size variables.
#' Alternatively, observation status may be input via \code{obs2col} and
#' \code{obs3col} to force computation with given values (although this requires
#' all instances of observation and non-observation to be known and coded ahead
#' of time). Further analysis can then utilize only a single size variable, of
#' the user's choosing. Similar issues can arise in reproductive status
#' (\code{repstatus}).
#' 
#' Juvenile designation should only be used when juveniles fall outside of the
#' size classification scheme used in determining stages. If juveniles are to be
#' size classified along the size spectrum that adults also fall on, then
#' it is best to treat juveniles as mature but not reproductive.
#' 
#' Care should be taken to avoid variables with negative values indicating size,
#' fecundity, or reproductive or observation status. Negative values can be
#' interpreted in different ways, typically reflecting estimation through other
#' algorithms rather than actual measured data. Variables holding negative
#' values can conflict with data management algorithms in ways that are
#' difficult to predict.
#' 
#' Unusual errors (e.g. \code{"Error in pjf..."}) may occur in cases where the
#' variables are improperly passed, or where seemingly numeric variables include
#' text and so get automatically converted to string variables.
#' 
#' Density estimation is performed as a count of individuals alive and within
#' the radius specified in \code{spacing} of the respective individual at some
#' point in time.

#' Create lefkoMat Object from Given Input Matrices or an MPM Database
#' 
#' Function \code{create_lM()} creates lefkoMat objects from supplied matrices
#' and extra information, or from a supplied MPM database such as COMPADRE or
#' COMADRE.
#' 
#' @name create_lM
#' 
#' @param mats A list of A matrices, or, if importing from a matrix database
#' such as COMPADRE or COMADRE, then the object holding the database.
#' @param stageframe A stageframe describing all stages utilized.
#' @param hstages A data frame outlining the order of historical stages, if
#' matrices provided in \code{mats} are historical. Defaults to NA.
#' @param agestages A data frame outlining the order of ahistorical age-stages,
#' if age-by-stage matrices are provided.
#' @param historical A logical value indicating whether input matrices are
#' historical or not. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param agebystage A logical value indicating whether input matrices are
#' ahistorical age-by-stage matrices. If TRUE, then object \code{agestages} is
#' required. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param UFdecomp A logical value indicating whether U and F matrices should be
#' inferred. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param entrystage The stage or stages produced by reproductive individuals.
#' Used to determine which transitions are reproductive for U-F decomposition.
#' Defaults to \code{1}, which corresponds to the first stage in the stageframe.
#' @param poporder The order of populations in the list supplied in object
#' \code{mats}. Defaults to 1.
#' @param patchorder The order of patches in the list supplied in object
#' \code{mats}. Defaults to 1.
#' @param yearorder The order of monitoring occasions in the list supplied in
#' object \code{mats}. Defaults to NA, which leads to each matrix within each
#' population-patch combination being a different monitoring occasion.
#' @param matrix_id The values of \code{MatrixID} from the used database
#' corresponding to the matrices to import, if importing from a database. Not
#' used if importing a list of matrices.
#' @param add_FC A logical value indicating whether to sum the \code{matF} and
#' \code{matC} matrices to produce the \code{F} matrix. If \code{FALSE}, then
#' only uses the \code{matF} matrix. Only used if importing from the COMPADRE or
#' COMADRE database. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param sparse_output A logical value indicating whether to output matrices in
#' sparse format. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case all matrices are
#' output in standard matrix format. Does not apply to matrices imported from
#' COMPADRE or COMADRE, which are always in standard format.
#' 
#' @return A \code{lefkoMat} object incorporating the matrices input in object
#' \code{mats} as object \code{A}, their U and F decompositions in objects
#' \code{U} and \code{F} (if requested), the provided stageframe as object
#' \code{ahstages}, the order of historical stages as object \code{hstages} (if
#' \code{historical = TRUE}), the order of matrices as object \code{labels}, and
#' a short quality control section used by the \code{\link{summary.lefkoMat}()}
#' function.
#' 
#' @section Notes for importing lists of matrices:
#' Lists may be composed of a mix of matrices in standard R format (i.e. created
#' via the \code{matrix()} function), and in \code{dgCMatrix} sparse format
#' (i.e. created via the \code{Matrix::Matrix()} function with
#' \code{sparse = TRUE}.) All matrices will be forced to one or the other,
#' depending on the value given for the \code{sparse_output} argument.
#' 
#' U and F decomposition assumes that elements holding fecundity values are
#' to be interpreted solely as fecundity rates. Users wishing to split these
#' elements between fecundity and survival should do so manually after running
#' this function.
#' 
#' Age-by-stage MPMs require an \code{agestages} data frame outlining the order
#' of age-stages. This data frame has 3 variables: \code{stage_id}, which is the
#' number of the stage as labelled by the equivalently named variable in the
#' \code{stageframe}; \code{stage}, which is the official name of the stage as
#' given in the equivalently named variable in the \code{stageframe}; and
#' \code{age}, which of course gives the age associated with the stage at that
#' time. The number of rows must be equal to the number of rows and columns of
#' each entered matrix.
#' 
#' Users may edit the \code{dataqc} object, setting the first \code{NA} to the
#' number of individuals sampled, and the second \code{NA} to the number of
#' rows in a vertical version of the demographic dataset. This is not required,
#' however.
#' 
#' @section Notes for importing from COMPADRE or COMADRE:
#' For this function to operate, users must have either the COMPADRE database
#' or the COMADRE database loaded into the global environment. Note that the
#' sample databases supplied within package \code{Rcompadre} will not work with
#' this function.
#' 
#' This function does not and cannot replace the wonderful tools offered to
#' explore the COMPADRE and COMADRE packages. Please see package
#' \code{Rcompadre} to use those tools. Note that function \code{import_Com()}
#' has no relationship to the \code{Rcompadre} development team.
#' 
#' Function \code{import_Com()} requires that the dimensions of all matrices
#' imported into a single \code{lefkoMat} object be equal.
#' 
#' The reproductive and maturity status of each stage is determined by patterns
#' assessed within the \code{F} matrices. Users should check that these values
#' make sense.
#' 
#' Stage names may be edited manually afterward.
#' 
#' Users may edit the \code{dataqc} object, setting the first \code{NA} to the
#' number of individuals sampled, and the second \code{NA} to the number of
#' rows in a vertical version of the demographic dataset. This is not required,
#' however.

#' Add Matrices to lefkoMat Object
#' 
#' Function \code{add_lM()} adds matrices to lefkoMat objects.
#' 
#' @param lM The lefkoMat object to add matrices to.
#' @param Amats Either a single \code{A} matrix, or a list of \code{A} matrices.
#' Not necessary if \code{Umats} and \code{Fmats} are both provided.
#' @param Umats Either a single \code{U} matrix, or a list of \code{U} matrices.
#' Not necessary if \code{Amats} and \code{Fmats} are both provided, or if
#' \code{UFdecomp = TRUE} and \code{entrystage} is provided.
#' @param Fmats Either a single \code{F} matrix, or a list of \code{U} matrices.
#' Not necessary if \code{Amats} and \code{Umats} are both provided, or if
#' \code{UFdecomp = TRUE} and \code{entrystage} is provided.
#' @param UFdecomp A logical value indicating whether U and F matrices should be
#' inferred from A matrices and the given \code{entrystage}. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param entrystage The stage or stages produced by reproductive individuals.
#' Used to determine which transitions are reproductive for U-F decomposition.
#' Defaults to \code{1}, which corresponds to the first stage in the stageframe.
#' @param pop The population designation for each matrix. If object \code{lM}
#' includes only a single population, then defaults to that designation.
#' Otherwise requires a designation as input.
#' @param patch The patch designation for each matrix. If object \code{lM}
#' includes only a single patch, then defaults to that designation. Otherwise
#' requires a designation as input.
#' @param year The designation for occasion at time \emph{t} corresponding to
#' each matrix. Cannot be left empty.
#' 
#' @return A \code{lefkoMat} object incorporating the new matrices within the
#' object input in \code{lM}. 
#' 
#' @section Notes:
#' This function will not allow matrices of different dimension from those input
#' in object \code{lM} to be added to that object.
#' 
#' Two of \code{Amats}, \code{Umats}, and \code{Fmats} must be provided for this
#' function to proceed. Also, if \code{Amats}, \code{Umats}, and \code{Fmats}
#' are all provided, then this function will default to replacing \code{Amats}
#' with the sum of the respective \code{Umats} and \code{Fmats}.
