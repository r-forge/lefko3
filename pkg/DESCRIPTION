Description: Complete analytical environment for the construction and analysis
             of matrix population models and integral projection models.
             Includes the ability to construct historical matrices, which are
             2d matrices comprising 3 consecutive times of demographic
             information. Estimates both raw and function-based forms of
             historical and standard ahistorical matrices. It also estimates
             function-based age-by-stage matrices and raw and function-based
             Leslie matrices.
