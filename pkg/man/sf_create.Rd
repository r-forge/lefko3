\arguments{
\item{sizes}{A numeric vector of the typical or representative size of each
life history stage. If making function-based MPMs, then this should be a
vector composed of the midpoints of each size bin. If denoting the boundary
of an automated size classification group, then should denote the absolute
minimum size of that group, or the absolute size of that group (see
\code{Notes}).}

\item{stagenames}{A vector of stage names, in the same order as elements in
sizes. Can also be set to \code{ipm} for automated size classification (see
\code{Notes} section).}

\item{sizesb}{An optional numeric vector for a second size metric for each
life history stage. Only to be used if stages are defined by at least two
size metrics in all cases. Same issues apply as in \code{sizes}.}

\item{sizesc}{An optional numeric vector for a third size metric for each
life history stage. Only to be used if stages are defined by at least three
size metrics in all cases. Same issues apply as in \code{sizes}.}

\item{repstatus}{A vector denoting the binomial reproductive status of each
life history stage. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{obsstatus}{A vector denoting the binomial observation status of each
life history stage. Defaults to \code{1}, but may be changed for
unobservable stages.}

\item{propstatus}{A vector denoting whether each life history stage is a 
propagule. Such stages are generally only used in fecundity estimation. 
Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{matstatus}{A vector denoting whether each stage is mature. Must be
composed of binomial values if given. Defaults to 1 for all stages defined 
in \code{sizes}.}

\item{immstatus}{A vector denoting whether each stage is immature. Must be
composed of binomial values if given. Defaults to the complement of vector
\code{matstatus}.}

\item{minage}{An optional vector denoting the minimum age at which a stage
can occur. Only used in age x stage matrix development. Defaults to
\code{NA}.}

\item{maxage}{An optional vector denoting the maximum age at which a stage
should occur. Only used in age x stage matrix development. Defaults to
\code{NA}.}

\item{indataset}{A vector designating which stages are found within the 
dataset. While \code{\link{rlefko2}()} and \code{\link{rlefko3}()} can use
all stages in the input dataset, \code{\link{flefko3}()} and
\code{\link{flefko2}()} can only handle size-classified stages with
non-overlapping combinations of size and status variables. Stages that do
not actually exist within the dataset should be marked as \code{0} in this
vector.}

\item{binhalfwidth}{A numeric vector giving the half-width of size bins.
Required to classify individuals appropriately within size classes.
Defaults to \code{0.5} for all sizes.}

\item{binhalfwidthb}{A numeric vector giving the half-width of size bins
used for the optional second size metric. Required to classify individuals
appropriately with two or three size classes. Defaults to \code{0.5} for all
sizes.}

\item{binhalfwidthc}{A numeric vector giving the half-width of size bins
used for the optional third size metric. Required to classify individuals
appropriately with three size classes. Defaults to \code{0.5} for all sizes.}

\item{group}{An integer vector providing information on each respective
stage's size classification group. If used, then function-based MPM creation
functions \code{\link{flefko2}()}, \code{\link{flefko3}()}, and
\code{\link{aflefko2}()} will estimate transitions only within these groups
and for allowed cross-group transitions noted within the supplement table.
Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{comments}{An optional vector of text entries holding useful text
descriptions of all stages.}

\item{roundsize}{This parameter sets the precision of size classification,
and equals the number of digits used in rounding sizes. Defaults to
\code{5}.}

\item{roundsizeb}{This parameter sets the precision of size classification
in the optional second size metric, and equals the number of digits used in
rounding sizes. Defaults to \code{5}.}

\item{roundsizec}{This parameter sets the precision of size classification
in the optional third size metric, and equals the number of digits used in
rounding sizes. Defaults to \code{5}.}

\item{ipmbins}{An integer giving the number of size bins to create using the
primary size classification variable. This number is in addition to any
stages that are not size classified. Defaults to \code{100}, and numbers
greater than this yield a warning about the loss of statistical power and
increasing chance of matrix over-parameterization resulting from increasing
numbers of stages.}

\item{ipmbinsb}{An optional integer giving the number of size bins to create
using the secondary size classification variable. This number is in addition
to any stages that are not size classified, as well as in addition to any
automated size classification using the primary and tertiary size variables.
Defaults to \code{NA}, and must be set to a positive integer for automated
size classification to progress.}

\item{ipmbinsc}{An optional integer giving the number of size bins to create
using the tertiary size classification variable. This number is in addition
to any stages that are not size classified, as well as in addition to any
automated size classification using the primary and secondary size
variables. Defaults to \code{NA}, and must be set to a positive integer for
automated size classification to progress.}

\description{
Function \code{sf_create()} returns a data frame describing each ahistorical
life history stage in the life history model. This data frame can be used as 
input into MPM creation functions including \code{\link{flefko3}()}, 
\code{\link{flefko2}()}, \code{\link{aflefko2}()}, \code{\link{rlefko3}()},
\code{\link{rlefko2}()}, and \code{\link{arlefko2}()}, in which it
determines how each stage is treated during matrix estimation.

\section{Notes}{

Vectors used to create a stageframe may not mix \code{NA} values with
non-\code{NA} values.

If an IPM or function-based matrix with automated size classification is
desired, then two stages that occur within the dataset and represent the
lower and upper size limits of the IPM must be marked with \code{ipm} in
the stagenames vector. These stages should have all characteristics other
than size equal, and the size input for whichever size will be classified
automatically must include the minimum in one stage and the maximum in the
other. The actual characteristics of the first stage encountered in the
inputs will be used as the template for the creation of these sizes. Note
that \code{ipm} refers to size classification with the primary size
variable. To automate size classification with the secondary size variable,
use \code{ipmb}, and to automate size classification with the tertiary size
variable, use \code{ipmc}. To nest automated size classifications, use 
\code{ipmab} for the primary and secondary size variables, \code{ipmac} for
the primary and tertiary size variables, \code{ipmbc} for the secondary and
tertiary size variables, and \code{ipmabc} for all three size variables.
The primary size variable can also be set with \code{ipma}.

If two or more groups of stages, each with its own characteristics, are to
be developed for an IPM or function-based MPM, then an even number of stages
with two stages marking the minimum and maximum size of each group should be
marked with the same code as given above, with all other characteristics
equal within each group.

Stage classification groups set with the \code{group} variable create zones
within function-based matrices in which survival transitions are estimated.
These groups should not be set if transitions are possible between all
stages regardless of group. To denote specific transitions as estimable
between stage groups, use the \code{\link{supplemental}()} function.

If importing an IPM rather than building one with \code{lefko3}: Using the
\code{vrm_input} approach to building function-based MPMs with provided
linear model slope coefficients requires careful attention to the
stageframe. Although no hfv data frame needs to be entered in this instance,
stages for which vital rates are to be estimated via linear models
parameterized with coefficients provided via function
\code{\link{vrm_import}()} should be marked as occurring within the dataset,
while stages for which the provided coefficients should not be used should
be marked as not occurring within the dataset.
