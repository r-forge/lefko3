which size variable within the input dataset is chosen. Note that the
variable(s) chosen should be presented in the order of the primary,

interpreted as not observed in the dataset as though they were observed
during stage assignment. This can be useful when a MPM is desired without
separation of observable and unobservable stages. Only used if
\code{stageassign} is set to a stageframe. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
If all inputs are properly formatted, then this function will output
a historical vertical data frame (class \code{hfvdata}), meaning that the
output data frame will have three consecutive years of size and reproductive
data per individual per row. This data frame is in standard format for all
functions used in \code{lefko3}, and so can be used without further 
modification. Note that determination of state in occasions \emph{t}-1 and
\emph{t}+1 gives preference to condition in occasion \emph{t} within the
input dataset. Conflicts in condition in input datasets that have both
occasions \emph{t} and \emph{t}+1 listed per row are resolved by using
condition in occasion \emph{t}.

Variables in this data frame include the following:
\item{rowid}{Unique identifier for the row of the data frame.}
\item{popid}{Unique identifier for the population, if given.}
\item{patchid}{Unique identifier for patch within population, if given.}
\item{individ}{Unique identifier for the individual.}

\description{
Function \code{historicalize3()} returns a vertically formatted demographic
data frame organized to create historical projection matrices, given a
vertically but ahistorically formatted data frame. This data frame is in
standard \code{hfvdata} format and can be used in all functions in the

\section{Notes}{

Warnings that some individuals occur in state combinations that do not match
any stages in the stageframe used to assign stages, and that some individuals
match characteristics of several stages in the stageframe, are common when
first working with a dataset. Typically, these situations can be identified as
\code{NoMatch} entries in \code{stage3}, although such entries may crop up in
\code{stage1} and \code{stage2}, as well. In some cases, these warnings will
arise with no concurrent \code{NoMatch} entries. These are important warnings
and suggest that there is likely a problem with the stageframe. The most
common such problems are: 1) stages have significant overlap in
characteristics, with the most common being overlapping size bins caused by
erroneous definitions of size bin halfwidths; and 2) some individuals exist
in states not defined within the stageframe.

In some datasets with unobservable stages, observation status
(\code{obsstatus}) might not be inferred properly if a single size variable
is used that does not yield sizes greater than 0 in all cases in which
individuals were observed. Such situations may arise, for example, in plants
when leaf number is the dominant size variable used, but individuals
occasionally occur with inflorescences but no leaves. In this instances,
it helps to mark related variables as \code{sizeb} and \code{sizec}, because
observation status will be interpreted in relation to all 3 size variables.
Alternatively, observation status may be input via \code{obs2col} and
\code{obs3col} to force computation with given values (although this requires
all instances of observation and non-observation to be known and coded ahead
of time). Further analysis can then utilize only a single size variable, of
the user's choosing. Similar issues can arise in reproductive status
(\code{repstatus}).

Juvenile designation should only be used when juveniles fall outside of the
size classification scheme used in determining stages. If juveniles are to be
size classified along the size spectrum that adults also fall on, then
it is best to treat juveniles as mature but not reproductive.

Care should be taken to avoid variables with negative values indicating size,
fecundity, or reproductive or observation status. Negative values can be
interpreted in different ways, typically reflecting estimation through other
algorithms rather than actual measured data. Variables holding negative
values can conflict with data management algorithms in ways that are
difficult to predict.

Unusual errors (e.g. \code{"Error in pjf..."}) may occur in cases where the
variables are improperly passed, or where seemingly numeric variables include
text and so get automatically converted to string variables.

Density estimation is performed as a count of individuals alive and within
the radius specified in \code{spacing} of the respective individual at some
point in time.
