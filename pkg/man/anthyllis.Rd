\title{Matrix Set of \emph{Anthyllis vulneraria} Populations in Belgium}
\format{
A \code{lefkoMat} object holding 27 matrices. The structure of the
object is as below:

\describe{
  \item{A}{The 27 A matrices.}
  \item{U}{The 27 survival-transition matrices used to develop the A
  matrices.}
  \item{F}{The 27 fecundity matrices used to develop the A matrices.}
  \item{hstages}{Not used, so set to \code{NA}.}
  \item{agestages}{Not used, so set to \code{NA}.}
  \item{ahstages}{The edited stageframe describing the life history of the
  study organism as interpreted in the original demographic study.}
  \item{labels}{The order of the matrices, where each population is treated
  as a separate patch and each matrix corresponds to a different combination
  of population and year in time \emph{t}.}
  \item{matrixqc}{A vector of integers used in the quality control section of
  \code{lefkoMat} summary statements.}

\description{
A \code{lefkoMat} object containing projection matrices developed from
demographic data gathered on nine \emph{Anthyllis vulneraria} populations
from 2003 to 2006 in southwestern Belgium. These matrices were originally
published in Davison et al. (2010; Journal of Eccology 98(2): 255-267).
