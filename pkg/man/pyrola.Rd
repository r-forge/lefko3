\title{Demographic Dataset of \emph{Pyrola japonica} and \emph{Pyrola subaphylla}
Populations, in Horizontal Format}
\format{
A data frame with 454 individuals and 57 variables. Each row 
corresponds to an unique individual, and each variable from
\code{sprouted.2015} on refers to the state of the individual in a particular
year.

  \item{species}{String denoting which of the two species the individual
  belongs to.}
  \item{population}{Integer denoting whcih population the individual belongs
  to. Synonymous with species in this dataset.}

  individual within each species. Note that numbers are reused among the two
  species.}

  living aboveground tissue observable in the 2015 census.}
