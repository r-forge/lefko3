\arguments{
\item{year}{A variable corresponding to the observation occasion, or a set
of such values, given in values associated with the year term used in linear 
model development. Defaults to \code{"all"}, in which case matrices will be
estimated for all occasions.}

\item{patch}{A variable designating which patches or subpopulations will have
matrices estimated. Defaults to \code{"all"}, but can also be set to specific
patch names or a vector thereof.}

\item{stageframe}{An object of class \code{stageframe}. These objects are
generated by function \code{\link{sf_create}()}, and include information on
the size, observation status, propagule status, reproduction status,
immaturity status, maturity status, stage group, size bin widths, and other
key characteristics of each ahistorical stage.}

\item{supplement}{An optional data frame of class \code{lefkoSD} that
provides supplemental data that should be incorporated into the MPM. Three
kinds of data may be integrated this way: transitions to be estimated via the
use of proxy transitions, transition overwrites from the literature or
supplemental studies, and transition multipliers for survival and fecundity.
This data frame should be produced using the \code{\link{supplemental}()}
function. Can be used in place of or in addition to an overwrite table (see 
\code{overwrite} below) and a reproduction matrix (see \code{repmatrix}
below).}

\item{repmatrix}{An optional reproduction matrix. This matrix is composed
mostly of \code{0}s, with non-zero entries acting as element identifiers and
multipliers for fecundity (with \code{1} equaling full fecundity). If left
blank, and no \code{supplement} is provided, then \code{aflefko2()} will
assume that all stages marked as reproductive produce offspring at 1x that of
estimated fecundity, and that offspring production will yield the first stage
noted as propagule or immature. Must be the dimensions of an ahistorical
stage-based matrix.}

\code{\link{overwrite}()} function describing transitions to be overwritten
either with given values or with other estimated transitions. Note that this
function supplements overwrite data provided in \code{supplement}.}

\item{data}{The historical vertical demographic data frame used to estimate
vital rates (class \code{hfvdata}), which is required to initialize times and
patches properly. Variable names should correspond to the naming conventions

to the patches and occasions given, including the associated component

\section{Notes}{

Unlike \code{\link{rlefko2}()}, \code{\link{rlefko3}()},
\code{\link{arlefko2}()}, and \code{\link{rleslie}()}, this function does not
currently distinguish populations. Users wishing to use the same vital rate
models across populations should label them as patches (though we do not
advise this approach, as populations should typically be treated as
statistically independent).

This function will yield incorrect estimates if the models utilized
incorporate state in occasion \emph{t}-1. Only use models developed testing
for ahistorical effects.

The default behavior of this function is to estimate fecundity with regards
to transitions specified via associated fecundity multipliers in either
\code{supplement} or \code{repmatrix}. If both of these fields are left
empty, then fecundity will be estimated at full for all transitions leading
from reproductive stages to immature and propagule stages. However, if a
\code{supplement} is provided and a \code{repmatrix} is not, or if
\code{repmatrix} is set to 0, then only fecundity transitions noted in the
supplement will be set to non-zero values. To use the default behavior of
setting all reproductive stages to reproduce at full fecundity into immature
and propagule stages but also incorporate given or proxy
survival transitions, input those given and proxy transitions through the
\code{overwrite} option.

The reproduction matrix (field \code{repmatrix}) may only be supplied as
ahistorical. If provided as historical, then \code{aflefko2()} will fail and
produce an error.

Stageframes used in this function should include ages for minimum and maximum
age for each stage. \code{NA}s are treated as \code{0}s in minimum age, and
as \code{final_age} for maximum age.

Users may at times wish to estimate MPMs using a dataset incorporating
multiple patches or subpopulations, but without discriminating between those
patches or subpopulations. Should the aim of analysis be a general MPM that
does not distinguish these patches or subpopulations, the
\code{modelsearch()} run should not include patch terms.

Input options including multiple variable names must be entered in the order
of variables in occasion \emph{t}+1 and \emph{t}. Rearranging the order will
lead to erroneous calculations, and may lead to fatal errors.

Care should be taken to match the random status of year and patch to the
states of those variables within the \code{modelsuite}. If they do not match,
then they will be treated as zeroes in vital rate estimation.

The \code{ipm_method} function gives the option of using two different means
of estimating the probability of size transition. The midpoint method
(\code{"midpoint"}) refers to the method in which the probability is
estimated by first estimating the probability associated with transition from
the exact size at the midpoint of the size class using the corresponding
probability density function, and then multiplying that value by the bin
width of the size class. Doak et al. 2021 (Ecological Monographs) noted that
this method can produce biased results, with total size transitions
associated with a specific size not totaling to 1.0 and even specific size
transition probabilities capable of being estimated at values greater than
1.0. The alternative and default method, \code{"CDF"}, uses the corresponding
cumulative density function to estimate the probability of size transition as
the cumulative probability of size transition at the greater limit of the
size class minus the cumulative probability of size transition at the lower
limit of the size class. The latter method avoids this bias. Note, however,
that both methods are exact and unbiased for the Poisson and negative
binomial distributions.

Under the Gaussian and gamma size distributions, the number of estimated
parameters may differ between the two \code{ipm_method} settings. Because
the midpoint method has a tendency to incorporate upward bias in the
estimation of size transition probabilities, it is more likely to yield non-
zero values when the true probability is extremely close to 0. This will
result in the \code{summary.lefkoMat} function yielding higher numbers of
estimated parameters than the \code{ipm_method = "CDF"} yields in some cases.

Using the \code{err_check} option will produce a matrix of 7 columns, each
characterizing a different vital rate. The product of each row yields an
element in the associated \code{U} matrix. The number and order of elements
in each column of this matrix matches the associated matrix in column vector
format. Use of this option is generally for the purposes of debugging code.

Individual covariates are treated as categorical only if they are set as
random terms. Fixed categorical individual covariates are currently not
allowed. However, such terms may be supplied if the \code{modelsuite} option
is set to a \code{vrm_input} object. In that case, the user should also set
the logical random switch for the individual covariate to be used to 
\code{TRUE} (e.g., \code{random.inda = TRUE}).
