  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In this vignette, we use the `cypdata` dataset to illustrate the estimation of **function-based MPMs**. To reduce output size, we have prevented some statements from running if they produce long stretches of output. Examples include most `summary()` calls. In these cases, we include hashtagged versions of these calls, and our text assumes that the user runs these statements without hashtags. We have also written this vignette using the default Ehrlén format as the output format for all historical MPMs. All examples work with deVries format as well. This vignette is only a sample analysis. Detailed information and instructions on using `lefko3` are available through a free online e-book called *lefko3: a gentle introduction*, available on <a href = "http://www.sheffersonlab.com/projects">the projects page</a> of the Shefferson lab website. This website also includes links to long-format vignettes and other demonstrations of this package.</p>
  
### ORGANISM AND POPULATION
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The white lady's slipper, *Cypripedium candidum*, is a North American perennial herb in the family Orchidaceae. It is long-lived and of conservation concern. The population from which the dataset originates is located within a state nature preserve located in northeastern Illinois, USA. The population was monitored annually from 2004 to 2009, with two monitoring sessions per year. Monitoring sessions took roughly 2 weeks each, and included complete censuses of the population divided into sections referred to as patches. Each monitoring session consisted of searches for previously recorded individuals, which were located according to coordinates relative to fixed stakes at the site, followed by a search for new individuals. Data recorded per individual included: the location, the number of non-flowering sprouts, the number of flowering sprouts, the number of flowers per flowering sprout, and the number of fruit pods per sprout (only in the second monitoring session per year, once fruiting had occurred). Location was used to infer individual identity. More information about this population and its characteristics is given in @shefferson_estimating_2001 and @shefferson_predicting_2017.</p>
  
### BASIC WORKFLOW
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Population matrix projection modeling requires an appropriate life history model showing how all stages and transitions are related. The figure below shows a very general life history model detailing these relationships in *Cypripedium candidum*. The first stage of life is a dormant seed stage, although an individual may germinate in the year following seed production. The first germinated stage is a protocorm, which is an underground, mycoheterotrophic stage unique to the families Orchidaceae and Pyrolaceae. There are three years of protocorm stages, followed by a seedling stage, and finally a set of stages that comprise the size-classified adult portion of life. The figure shows 49 such stages, each for a different number of stems (including zero for vegetative dormancy) and one of two reproductive statuses. These stages may be reorganized for different circumstances (more on this later).</p>

Figure 5.1. Life history model of *Cypripedium candidum*. Survival transitions are indicated with solid arrows, while fecundity transitions are indicated with dashed arrows.

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We can see a variety of transitions within this figure. The juvenile stages have fairly simple transitions. New recruits may enter the population directly from germination of a seed produced the previous year, in which case they start in the protocorm 1 stage, or they may begin as dormant seed. Dormant seed may remain dormant, die, or germinate into the protocorm 1 stage. Protocorms exist for up to 3 years, yielding the protocorm 1, 2, and 3 stages, without any possibility of staying within each of these stages for more than a single year. Protocorm 3 leads to a seedling stage, in which the plant may persist for many years before becoming mature. Here, maturity does not really refer to reproduction *per se*, but rather to a morphology indistinguishable from a reproductive plant except for the lack of a flower. The first mature stage is usually either vegetative dormancy (`Dorm`), during which time the plant does not sprout, or a small, non-flowering adult (`1V`). Once in this portion of the life history, the plant may transition among 49 mature stages, including vegetative dormancy, 1-24 shoots without flowers, or 1-24 shoots with at least one flower (we have never observed a plant bigger than this in the population).</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The horizontal dataset `cypdata`, and the ahistorical vertical dataset `cypvert` which is the same as `cypdata` but is structured differently, both include only data for the adult stages, and so later we will need to set juvenile transitions to constants. Let's begin by clearing the memory, loading the package and the dataset, and looking over a summary of the latter.</p>

#### Step 1. Life history model development 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We will first describe the life history characterizing the population, matching it to our dataset with a *stageframe* for our *Cypripedium candidum* dataset. Since this analysis will be function-based and all sizes have reasonable representation, we will include all observed size classes here. Since size is count-based in the *Cypripedium candidum* case, we will use all numbers of stems that occurred, representing the life history diagram shown previously.</p>

cypframe <- sf_create(sizes = sizevector, stagenames = stagevector, 
  repstatus = repvector, obsstatus = obsvector, matstatus = matvector, 
  propstatus = propvector, immstatus = immvector, indataset = indataset,
  comments = comments)
#cypframe
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">A close look at the resulting object, `cypframe`, shows a data frame that includes the following information in order for each stage: the stage's name; the associated primary, secondary, and tertiary sizes; the minimum and maximum ages associated with the stage; its reproductive status; its status as an observable stage; its status as a propagule stage; its status as an immature stage; its status as a mature stage; whether it occurs in the dataset; the half-width, minimum, maximum, centroid, and full width of its primary, secondary, and tertiary size class bin; stage group number; and a comments field describing the stage. We only used a primary size variable, so values for the secondary and tertiary sizes are `NA`s. Stage names and combinations of characteristics occurring within the dataset must be unique to prevent estimation errors, and the comments field may be edited to include any information deemed pertinent.</p>
  
#### Step 2a. Data standardization 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now we will standardize our vertical dataset into a historically-formatted vertical (*hfv*) data frame using the `verticalize3()` function. The resulting dataset will have each individual's observed life history broken up into states corresponding to three consecutive monitoring occasions (years) per row, with plant identity marked in each row.</p>
```{r Ch5.2}
vertdata <- verticalize3(data = cypdata, noyears = 6, firstyear = 2004, 
  patchidcol = "patch", individcol = "plantid", blocksize = 4, 
  sizeacol = "Inf2.04", sizebcol = "Inf.04", sizeccol = "Veg.04", 
  repstracol = "Inf.04", repstrbcol = "Inf2.04", fecacol = "Pod.04", 
  stageassign = cypframe, stagesize = "sizeadded", NAas0 = TRUE)
#summary(vertdata)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In the above code, we described the input dataset in a way that allows R to reorganize it appropriately. Note that in the input to the function, we utilized a repeating pattern of variable names arranged in the same order for each monitoring occasion. This arrangement allows us to enter only the first variable in each set, as long as `noyears` and `blocksize` are set properly and no gaps or shuffles appear among columns in the dataset. `lefko3`'s data management functions do not require such repeating patterns, but such patterns do make the required function input much more succinct. Without these patterns, column names should be input as vectors in the correct temporal order for each input option, and the `blocksize` option should be omitted.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The output dataset includes a number of summary variables, but the data is essentially broken down into groups of three consecutive monitoring occasions each (occasions *t*+1, *t*, and *t*-1, corresponding to `year3`, `year2`, and `year1` in the output, respectively), with individuals spread across multiple rows. The output dataset is further limited to those entries in which the individual is alive in occasion *t* (`year2`), meaning that all rows in which an individual is dead or not yet recruited in occasion *t* are dropped. We end up with `r dim(vertdata)[1]` rows of data and `r dim(vertdata)[2]` variables.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">This reorganized dataset includes a set of interesting terms that were automatically calculated: the `sizeadded` group of three variables. These are sums of the size variables for each occasion, such that `size1added` is calculated as `sizea1 + sizeb1 + sizec1`. This may or may not make sense depending on the dataset. In this dataset, the full size of the individual in each occasion is this sum, because size is determined as the number of stems per plant, and the three original size columns give the numbers of three different kinds of stems: `Veg`, `Inf`, and `Inf2` are the numbers of non-reproductive stems, single-flowered inflorescences, and double-flowered inflorescences, respectively, per plant per occasion (an inflorescence is a single flowering stem, and no inflorescence has more than two flowers). Since size is given as the total number of stems in this example, we will use the `sizeadded` group of variables to code individual size.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Size and fecundity are both count variables here, and we need to determine the appropriate distribution to use in both cases. Let's look at histograms of size and fecundity in occasion *t*.</p>
```{r Ch5.3, fig.cap = "Figure 5.2. Histogram of Cypripedium candidum size and fecundity in occasion t"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(vertdata$size2added, main = "Size in time t", xlab = "No. of stems in time t")
hist(subset(vertdata, repstatus2 == 1)$feca2, main = "Fecundity in time t", 
  xlab = "No. of fruit pods in time t")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Stem number has a very low mean, and the curve declines fairly smoothly. The Poisson or negative binomial distribution might work for size. Fecundity appears to have many zeros, suggesting that we might need a zero-inflated count distribution. Let's conduct a formal set of tests to determine the appropriate distributions for size and fecundity. The size of zero is actually absorbed in an unobservable stage, vegetative dormancy (stage `D`), so we will not test for zero-inflation in the size variable. However, we will test for zero-inflation in fecundity, since fecundity is measured as the number of fruit pods produced, while all flowering individuals are treated as reproductive and so some individuals must have fecundity of zero.</p>
```{r Ch5.4}
sf_distrib(vertdata, sizea = c("size3added", "size2added"), obs3 = "obsstatus3",
  fec = c("feca3", "feca2"), repst = c("repstatus3", "repstatus2"),
  zisizea = FALSE)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The results of these tests show us that size is overdispersed. Since we have no zeros in size, we will use the zero-truncated negative binomial distribution for this vital rate. Our tests of fecundity show no significant overdispersion, but the number of zeros exceeds expectation, suggesting that we use a zero-inflated Poisson distribution.</p>
  
#### Step 2b. Vertical dataset standardization 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We may also wish to see how to proceed if our original dataset is already in vertical, ahistorical format, or a format in which each row gives the state of an individual in a single monitoring occasion. This package also includes dataset `cypvert`, which is the same dataset as `cypdata` but set in ahistorical vertical format. Here, we use the `historicalize3()` function to deal with this dataset. First, let's load the ahistorical vertical raw data file, look at its dimensions relative to the original, horizontal dataset, and finally view a summary.</p>
```{r Ch5.5}
data(cypvert)
dim(cypdata)
dim(cypvert)
#summary(cypvert)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">This dataset has more rows and fewer columns, because we constructed the dataset by splitting the data for each individual across multiple rows. After three columns of identifying information (`plantid`, `patch`, and `censor`), a single column designates the time of occasion *t*, given as `year2`. This dataset then includes columns showing individual state in pairs of consecutive years corresponding to occasions *t* and *t*+1. State in occasion *t*-1 is not presented because this is an ahistorical dataset. This dataset includes the `plantid` variable, which is an individual identity term that allows us to associate rows with their individuals and so allows conversion. The `historicalize3()` function uses individual identity to reorganize datasets into historical vertical format.</p>
```{r Ch5.6}
vertdata2 <- historicalize3(data = cypvert, patchidcol = "patch",
  individcol = "plantid", year2col = "year2", sizea2col = "Inf2.2", 
  sizea3col = "Inf2.3", sizeb2col = "Inf.2", sizeb3col = "Inf.3", 
  sizec2col = "Veg.2", sizec3col = "Veg.3", repstra2col = "Inf2.2", 
  repstra3col = "Inf2.3", repstrb2col = "Inf.2", repstrb3col = "Inf.3", 
  feca2col = "Pod.2", feca3col = "Pod.3", repstrrel = 2, stageassign = cypframe,
  stagesize = "sizeadded", censorcol = "censor", censorkeep = 1, censor = FALSE,
  NAas0 = TRUE, reduce = TRUE)
#summary(vertdata2)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We can compare the dimensions of the new vertical datasets. The lengths of the datasets are the same in terms of rows and columns, and the variables and data are the same although the order of the columns and rows might not match (see the summaries for comparison).</p>
```{r Ch5.7}
dim(vertdata)
dim(vertdata2)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">One important consideration is the use of censor variables. Censoring a demographic dataset refers to the elimination of suspect data points from analysis. This is typically accomplished by including a binary variable in the dataset denoting whether an individual datum is to be kept or excluded. The objects `vertdata` and `vertdata2` were both created without using censoring variables. However, because the datasets included censor variables (all data were set to be included, with no suspect data), we wished to incorporate those variables in the final datasets. Hence, although `censor = FALSE` in both the call to `verticalize3()` and the call to `historicalize3()`, we also noted `censorcol = "censor"` and `censorkeep = 1` in the call to `historicalize3()` (the latter option specifies the value of the censor variable coding for a "good" datum). Failing to add these options to the call to `historicalize3()` will produce approximately the same dataset, but with some zeroes entering variables `censor1`, `censor2`, and `censor3` in the historicalized dataset that do not exist in the first, verticalized dataset.</p>
  
#### Step 2c. Provide supplemental information for matrix estimation  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The next steps involve adding some external data to parameterize the matrices properly. We will use the `supplemental()` function to do so. The `supplemental()` function provides a means of inputting four kinds of data into MPM construction:</p>
  
  1. fixed transition values derived from other studies and added as constants to matrices;
  2. proxy transition values when data for particular transitions does not exist and other, estimable transitions will be used as proxies;
  3. reproductive multipliers to indicate which stages lead to the production of which stages, and at what level relative to estimated fecundity; and
  4. survival multipliers, in cases in which proxy survival transitions are used but must be set at elevated or reduced levels relative to the original transition.
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We will create two supplement tables, the first covering the historical analysis, and the second covering the ahistorical analysis. Each row refers to a specific transition, and in the historical case, there are codes for 19 given transitions (12 for the ahistorical case). The first nine of the historical transitions are set to specific probabilities, and the next eight are transitions that will be set to other, estimated transitions acting as proxies (these are the non-NA transitions in `eststage` set below). The final two terms are fecundity multipliers. Based on the literature, the proxies for entry into the adult classes are transitions from dormancy, as below. Where necessary, we also use `rep` and `mat` as shorthand to code for all reproductive stages and all mature stages, respectively.</p>
```{r Ch5.8}

  stageframe = cypframe, historical = FALSE)
#cypsupp3
#cypsupp2
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">These supplement tables provide the best means of adding external data to our MPMs because they allow both specific transitions to be isolated, and because they allow the use of shorthand to identify large groups of transitions (i.e. using `mat`, `immat`, `rep`, `nrep`, `prop`, `npr`, `obs`, `nobs`, `groupX`, or `all` to signify all mature stages, immature stages, reproductive stages, non-reproductive stages, propagule stages, non-propagule stages, observable stages, unobservable stages, stages within group `X`, or simply all stages, respectively). They also allow more powerful changes to MPMs, such as block reset of groups of transitions to zero or other constants.</p>
  
#### Step 3. Tests of history, and vital rate modeling  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Matrix estimation can proceed either via raw matrix methods, as initially outlined in @ehrlen_dynamics_2000, or via function-based matrix development, essentially equivalent to the creation of complex integral projection models per @ellner_integral_2006 and as further described in the non-Gaussian case in @shefferson_life_2014. In the raw MPM case, no vital rate models are estimated, whereas in function-based MPMs, vital rates are first analyzed via linear or non-linear models of the raw demographic dataset, and then functions are created that estimate these vital rates according the inputs given. Matrices are then estimated using these functions, as opposed to the raw data.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Prior to vital rate estimation, a number of key decisions need to be made regarding the assumptions underlying the vital rates, and their relationships with the factors under investigation. These decisions include the **general modeling strategy**, and the **size and fecundity distributions**.</p>
  
#### Step 3a. General modeling strategy 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Most function-based matrices, whether integral projection models or otherwise, are developed using either a *generalized linear modeling (GLM)* strategy, or a *generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM, or mixed)* strategy. The former is more common and is simpler, but the latter is more theoretically sound because it provides a means of correcting the lack of independence inherent in datasets incorporating repeated sampling of the same individuals. The difference between the two methods with regards to vital rate modeling is strongly related to assumptions regarding individual and spatiotemporal variation in vital rates.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In both GLM and GLMM-based MPMs, the underlying dataset utilized is a vertical dataset. Each row of data gives the state of the individual in either two consecutive occasions (the ahistorical case), or three consecutive occasions (the historical case). Under the GLM framework, time in occasion *t* is a fixed categorical variable, and individual identity is ignored. Treating time as fixed implies that the actual monitoring occasions are the only times for which inference is sought. Thus, it would be inappropriate to infer future population dynamics after 2009 for a dataset collected between 2004 and 2009. Ignoring individual identity treats all transitions as independent, even though data originating from the same sampled individual is clearly not independent of that individual's previous transitions. This may be interpreted as a form of pseudoreplication because strongly related data is used to estimate matrix elements and matrices that are assumed to be statistically independent of each other. This might impact demographic modeling by inflating Type 1 error in the linear modeling, yielding more significant terms in the chosen best-fit model and causing the retention of more terms than is warranted.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Under the GLMM (generalized linear mixed model, or mixed) framework, both time and individual identity can be treated as random categorical terms. This has two major implications. First, both time and individuals can be assumed to be random samples from a broader population of times and individuals for which inference is sought. Thus, sampled monitoring occasions represent a greater universe of years for which inference can be made. Second, treating individual as a random categorical term eliminates the pseudoreplication that is inherent in the GLM approach when individuals are monitored potentially many times, because each individual is assumed to be randomly drawn and associated with its own response distribution. Subpopulations may also be considered random, in which case they are assumed to have been sampled from all possible subpopulations whether or not other subpopulations actually exist. We encourage researchers to use the GLMM approach in their demographic work, but we have also included easy-to-use GLM functionality, since many will find the GLM approach particularly useful in cases where mixed modeling breaks down or takes too long.</p>
  
#### Step 3b. Size and fecundity distributions
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Once a general approach is decided upon, the next step is to choose the underlying distributions. The probabilities of survival, observation, and reproductive status are automatically set to the binomial distribution, and this cannot be altered. However, size transition probability and fecundity rate can be set to the Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson, or negative binomial distributions, with zero-inflated and zero-truncated versions of the Poisson and negative binomial also available. If size or fecundity rate is a continuous variable, then it should be set to the Gaussian distribution if not too right-skewed; otherwise, the Gamma distribution may be better. If size or fecundity is a count variable, then it should be set to the Poisson distribution if the mean equals the variance. The negative binomial distribution is provided in cases where the assumption that the mean equals the variance is clearly broken.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The Poisson and the negative binomial distributions both predict specific numbers of zeros in the response variable. If excess zeros occur within the dataset, then a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial distribution may be used. These modeling approaches work by parameterizing a binomial model, typically with a logit link, to predict zero responses. The Poisson or negative binomial is then used to predict non-zero responses. This model is really two separate models in which zeros are assumed to be predicted under potentially different processes than the remaining counts. Because an extra model is built to cover the occurrence of zeros, zero-inflated models are more complex and can include many more parameters than their non-inflated counterparts. The principle of parsimony suggests that they should only be used when there are significantly more zeros than expected.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Cases may arise in which zeros do not exist in either size or fecundity. For these situations, we provide zero-truncated distributions. This may occur in size if all cases of `size = 0` are absorbed by observation status, leaving only positive integers for the size of observed individuals. For example, if an unobservable stage such as vegetative dormancy occurs and absorbs all cases of `size = 0`, then a zero-truncated Poisson or negative binomial distribution will be more appropriate than the equivalent distribution without zero-truncation. It can also occur if all cases of `fecundity = 0` are absorbed by reproductive status.</p>
  
#### Step 3c. Model building and selection  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In *lefko3*, function `modelsearch()` is the workhorse that conducts vital rate model estimation. Here, we will create a full suite of vital rate models for the *Cypripedium candidum* dataset. Before proceeding, we need to decide on the linear model building strategy, the correct vital rates to model, the proper statistical distributions for estimated vital rates, the proper parameterization of each vital rate, and the strategy for determination of the best-fit model for each vital rate.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">First, we must determine the model building strategy. In most cases, the best procedure will be through mixed linear models in which monitoring occasion and individual identity are random terms. We will set monitoring occasion as random because we wish to make inferences for the population as a whole and do not wish to restrict ourselves to inference only for the years monitored. We will set individual identity as random because many or most of the individuals that we have sampled to produce our dataset yield multiple observation data points across time. Thus, we will set `approach = "mixed"`. To make sure that time and individual identity are treated as random, we will set the proper variable names for `indiv` and `year`, corresponding to individual identity (`individ` by default), and to occasion *t* (`year2` by default). The `year.as.random` option is set to random by default, and leaving it this way also means that R will randomly draw coefficient values for years with inestimable coefficients. Setting `year.as.random` to `FALSE` would make time a fixed categorical variable.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Next, we must determine which vital rates to model. Function `modelsearch()` estimates up to fourteen vital rate models:</p>
  
  1) survival probability from occasion *t* to occasion *t*+1,
  
  2) observation probability in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival until that time, 
  
  3) primary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time, 
  
  4) secondary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time, 
  
  5) tertiary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time, 
  
  6) reproduction status in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation until that time,
  
  7) fecundity rate assuming survival until and observation and reproduction in the occasion of production of offspring (occasion *t* or *t*+1; mature only),
  
  8) juvenile survival probability from occasion *t* to occasion *t*+1,
  
  9) juvenile observation probability in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival until that time, 
  
  10) juvenile primary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time,
  
  11) juvenile secondary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time,
  
  12) juvenile tertiary size in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation in that time, and
  
  13) reproduction status in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival and observation until that time of a juvenile in occasion *t* that is becoming mature in occasion *t*+1.
  
  14) maturity status in occasion *t*+1 assuming survival until that time of a juvenile in occasion *t*.
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The default settings for `modelsearch` estimate 1) survival probability, 3) primary size distribution, and 7) fecundity, which are the minimum three vital rates required for a full MPM. Observation probability (option `obs` in `vitalrates`) should only be included when a life history stage or size exists that cannot be observed. For example, in the case of a plant with vegetative dormancy, the observation probability can be thought of as the sprouting probability, which is a biologically meaningful vital rate [@shefferson_estimating_2001]. Reproduction status (option `repst` in `vitalrates`) should only be modeled if size classification needs to be stratified by the ability to reproduce, as when equivalently sized stages exist differing in the ability to reproduce. Secondary and tertiary size should only be modeled when two or three size variables are used in stage classification. Since *Cypripedium candidum* is capable of long bouts of vegetative dormancy, since we wish to stratify the population into reproductive and non-reproductive adults of the same size classes, and since we have no data derived from juvenile individuals, we will set `vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec")` and leave the juvenile-related options at their defaults.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Third, we need to set the proper statistical distribution for each parameter. Survival probability, observation probability, and reproductive status (and maturity status) are all modeled as binomial variables, and this cannot be changed. In the case of this population of *Cypripedium candidum*, size was measured as the number of stems and so is a count variable. Likewise, fecundity is actually estimated as the number of fruits produced per plant, and so is also a count variable. We have already performed tests for overdispersion and zero-inflation, and we are also aware that size in observed stages cannot be 0, requiring zero truncation in that parameter. So we will set size to the zero-truncated negative binomial distribution, and fecundity to the zero-inflated Poisson distribution.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Fourth, we need the proper model parameterizations for each vital rate, using the `suite` option. The default, `suite = "main"`, under the mixed model setting (`approach = "mixed"`) starts with the estimation of global models that include size and reproductive status in occasions *t* and *t*-1 as fixed factors, with individual identity and time in occasion *t* (year *t*) set as random categorical terms. Other terms can be specified, including individual covariates, spatial density, and age. Setting `suite = "full"` will yield global models that also include all two-way interactions. The default under the GLM setting (`approach = "glm"`) makes time in occasion *t* a fixed term and drops individual identity from consideration. The global model under `suite = "full"` then includes all fixed factors noted before, plus all two-way interactions between fixed factors (`"full"` is the only setting with interaction terms). If the population is not stratified by reproductive status, then `suite = "size"` will eliminate reproductive status terms and use all others in the global model. If size is not important, then `suite = "rep"` will eliminate size but keep reproductive status and all other terms. Finally, `suite = "cons"` will result in a global model in which neither reproductive status nor size are considered, although optional terms such as age or spatial density may be still be incorporated. We will set `suite = "full"`. </p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, we need to determine the proper strategy for the determination of the best-fit model. Model building proceeds through the `dredge` function in package `MuMIn` [@barton_mumin_2014], and each model has an associated AICc value. The default setting in `lefko3` (`bestfit = "AICc&k"`) will compare all models within 2.0 AICc units of the model with $\Delta AICc = 0$, and choose the one with the lowest degrees of freedom. This approach is generally better than the alternative, which simply uses the model with $\Delta AICc = 0$ (`bestfit = "AICc"`), as all models within 2.0 AICc units of that model are equally parsimonious and so fewer degrees of freedom result from fewer parameters estimated [@burnham_model_2002].</p>
```{r Ch5.9}
cypmodels3 <- modelsearch(vertdata, historical = TRUE, approach = "mixed", 
  vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec"), sizedist = "negbin", 
  size.trunc = TRUE, fecdist = "poisson", fec.zero = TRUE, suite = "full", 
  size = c("size3added", "size2added", "size1added"), quiet = TRUE)
#summary(cypmodels3)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">As `modelsearch` works, it produces text describing its current processes and any issues encountered. It is quite likely that many warning messages will appear, and these may be of use in understanding the dataset and how well it conforms to analytical assumptions. We have silenced most of this with the `quiet = TRUE` option, although some red text still indicates a few warnings that have slipped through. These are not to be terribly concerned about. However, we encourage users to allow the function to run unsilenced in case of severe modeling problems. Please read the documentation for functions `lm()` (`stats` package), `glm()` (`stats` package), `glm.nb()` (`MASS` package), `lmer()` (`lme4` package), `glmer()` (`lme4` package), `glmmTMB()` (`glmmTMB` package), `zeroinfl()` (`pscl` package), `vglm()` (`VGAM` package), and `dredge()` (`MuMIn` package) for further information on the sources of problems in such models.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In the output, we see historical terms determining primary size, suggesting that we cannot ignore history. As such, the models created above are actually only usable for the construction of historical models. We can also see that although the accuracy of our survival and observation status models is very high (94.7% and 95% respectively), the accuracy of our reproductive status model is only fair (71.5%), and the pseudo R^2 for fecundity is only 32%. For comparison, we may wish to estimate ahistorical models. In that case, we also need linear models in which the global models tested do not include state at occasion *t*-1, as below.</p>
```{r Ch5.10}
cypmodels2 <- modelsearch(vertdata, historical = FALSE, approach = "mixed", 
  vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec"), sizedist = "negbin", 
  size.trunc = TRUE, fecdist = "poisson", fec.zero = TRUE, suite = "full", 
  size = c("size3added", "size2added"), quiet = TRUE)
#summary(cypmodels2)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Fewer models were estimated per dredge, since fewer parameters were tested in the global models (size and reproductive status in occasion *t*-1 were not included). So, the best-fit models should look a little bit different. However, a more thorough comparison will show that many of the best-fit models are similar between historical and ahistorical analysis, and that the only model different is the primary size model, which now shows only a y-intercept and random terms for monitoring occasion and individual. This is not guaranteed - in this case, it may be that the relatively small number of years and small overall sample size leaves too little power to find an impact of historical status on most vital rates. However, with size impacted by history, the choice of a historical model is better here.</p>
  
#### Step 4. MPM estimation 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now we will create function-based MPMs. Let's first create a set of ahistorical matrices.</p>
```{r Ch5.11}
cypmatrix2 <- flefko2(stageframe = cypframe, supplement = cypsupp2, 
  modelsuite = cypmodels2, data = vertdata, year.as.random = TRUE)
#summary(cypmatrix2)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">A quick glance at the summary output will highlight that many more elements are estimated for function-based matrices than for raw matrices - here, 2,459 out of 2,916 total elements (84.3%). In raw matrices, elements associated with transitions from specific stages are only estimated when individuals actually exist within those particular stages, and so the number of stages is strongly limited by the size of the dataset. In function-based matrices, in contrast, the linear models estimated allow the estimation of all elements that are theoretically possible (i.e. only structural zeros are not estimated), and so stages may be developed for the full range of sizes experienced by individuals.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The survival probability summaries at the bottom of the output provide a useful quality control check. These are calculated as the column sums from the associated survival-transition matrices. The use of externally-supplied rates and probabilities, as supplied via the supplement and overwrite tables, can result in some stages or stage-pairs having survival probabilities greater than 1.0, and if that occurs, then the supplement/overwrite tables need to be corrected to reduce survival to something reasonable. Our matrices here look perfectly fine.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The output of the `flefko2()` call includes several key elements. One of the most important is a data frame showing the order of matrices produced. Let's take a look at this object.</p>
```{r Ch5.12}
cypmatrix2$labels
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Here we see that our 5 matrices are annual matrices corresponding to the same population/patch. Other elements in this object include summaries of the stages used, in the order that they occur in the matrix. Since this is an ahistorical MPM, the key element here is `cypmatrix2$ahstages`. If this were a historical MPM, then `cypmatrix2$ahstages` would give the order of stages, and `cypmatrix2$hstages` would include the order of stage-pairs corresponding to the rows and columns in such MPMs.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Next, we will create a set of historical Lefkovitch matrices.</p>
```{r Ch5.13}
cypmatrix3 <- flefko3(stageframe = cypframe, supplement = cypsupp3, 
  modelsuite = cypmodels3, data = vertdata, yearcol = "year2",
  year.as.random = TRUE)
#summary(cypmatrix3)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We see many more total elements (over 8.5 million, in comparison to 2,916 in the ahistorical case), and many more rows and columns (54 rows and columns in the ahistorical case, and 54^2 = 2,916 rows and columns in the historical case). However, historical matrices are composed primarily of structural zeros. Thus, with only 117,712 + 2,352 = 120,064 elements estimated per matrix, only 1.4% of elements are non-zero (the equivalent percentage for the ahistorical case is 84.3%).</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's estimate some element-wise mean matrices. Here, we will create the ahistorical and historical mean MPMs and look at their summaries.</p>
```{r Ch5.14}
tmeans2r <- lmean(cypmatrix2)
tmeans3r <- lmean(cypmatrix3)
#summary(tmeans2r)
#summary(tmeans3r)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">It might help to do a more holistic comparison of the ahistorical vs. historical MPMs. Let's create matrix plots of the ahistorical and historical means. For this purpose, we will use the `image3()` function. Let's first view the ahistorical matrix image.</p>
```{r Ch5.15, fig.cap = "Figure 5.3. Image of ahistorical element-wise matrix mean"}
image3(tmeans2r, used = 1)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">This is a fairly large matrix, and rather dense though with obviously large clusters of zero elements particularly at the edges. Now let's see the historical matrix.</p>
```{r Ch5.16, fig.cap = "Figure 5.4. Images of historical element-wise matrix mean"}
image3(tmeans3r, used = 1)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Historical matrices are often huge and always sparse, just as our historical matrix is in the plot above. Although there are roughly 8.5 million elements, very few are non-zero and those are identified as the red streaks in the matrix image above.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">For further comparison, let's decompose the mean historical matrix into conditional historical matrices. We'll take a look at the matrix conditional on vegetative dormancy in occasion *t*-1.</p>
```{r Ch5.17}
condm3r <- cond_hmpm(tmeans3r)
#print(condm3r$Mcond[[1]]$D, digits = 3)
```
  
#### Step 5. MPM analysis 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Let's now conduct some projection analyses. First, we will estimate the deterministic and stochastic population growth rates for these means. The `set.seed()` function makes our stochastic results reproducible.</p>
```{r Ch5.18}
set.seed(42)
cypann2s <- slambda3(cypmatrix2)
set.seed(42)
cypann3s <- slambda3(cypmatrix3)

lambda3(tmeans2r)
lambda3(tmeans3r)
cypann2s
cypann3s
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">These $\lambda$ values are similar to one another, as are estimates of $a = \text{log} \lambda _{S}$. Let's take a look at a plot of annual deterministic growth rates (stochastic growth rate is calculated across time so is not included).</p>
```{r Ch5.19, fig.cap = "Figure 5.5. Ahistorical vs. historical annual population growth rate"}
cypann3 <- lambda3(cypmatrix3)
cypann2 <- lambda3(cypmatrix2)

plot(lambda ~ year2, data = cypann2, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Lambda", ylim = c(0.93, 0.98), type = "l", lty= 1, lwd = 2, bty = "n")
lines(lambda ~ year2, data = cypann3, lty = 2, lwd= 2, col = "red")
legend("bottomright", c("ahistorical", "historical"), lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "red"), lwd = 2, bty = "n")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We find that annual $\lambda$ estimates differ only slightly between ahistorical and historical analyses.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's take a look at the stable stage distributions. We will look at deterministic and stochastic versions of the ahistorical and historical MPMs.</p>
```{r Ch5.20, fig.cap = "Figure 5.6. Ahistorical vs. historically-corrected stable and long-run mean stage distribution"}
tm2ss <- stablestage3(tmeans2r)
tm3ss <- stablestage3(tmeans3r)
tm2ss_s <- stablestage3(cypmatrix2, stochastic = TRUE, seed = 42)
tm3ss_s <- stablestage3(cypmatrix3, stochastic = TRUE, seed = 42)

ss_put_together <- cbind.data.frame(tm2ss$ss_prop, tm3ss$ahist$ss_prop,
  tm2ss_s$ss_prop, tm3ss_s$ahist$ss_prop)
names(ss_put_together) <- c("det ahist", "det hist", "sto ahist", "sto hist")
rownames(ss_put_together) <- tm2ss$stage_id

barplot(t(ss_put_together), beside=T, ylab = "Proportion", xlab = "Stage", 
  ylim = c(0, 0.15), col = c("black", "orangered", "grey", "darkred"), bty = "n")
legend("topright", c("det ahist", "det hist", "sto ahist", "sto hist"),
  col = c("black", "orangered", "grey", "darkred"), pch = 15, bty = "n")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Overall, these are very similar patterns. Whether ahistorical or historical, deterministic or stochastic, our analyses suggest that small non-reproductive adults take up the greatest share of the stable stage structure, with dormant seed and 1st-year protocorms coming next, and then reproductive adults. The main differences appear to be a decreased presence of protocorms and increased presence of flowering adults in historical analysis.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Next let's look at the reproductive values associated with both ahistorical and historical approaches. We will standardize against the maximum value in each case to make these comparable in a single plot (normally we would not standardize across analyses like this, using the first or minimum reproductive value in each case for standardization instead).</p>
```{r Ch5.21, fig.cap = "Figure 5.7. Ahistorical vs. historically-corrected deterministic and stochastic reproductive values"}
tm2rv <- repvalue3(tmeans2r)
tm3rv <- repvalue3(tmeans3r)
tm2rv_s <- repvalue3(cypmatrix2, stochastic = TRUE, seed = 42)
tm3rv_s <- repvalue3(cypmatrix3, stochastic = TRUE, seed = 42)

rv_put_together <- cbind.data.frame((tm2rv$rep_value / max(tm2rv$rep_value)),
  (tm3rv$ahist$rep_value / max(tm3rv$ahist$rep_value)),

rownames(rv_put_together) <- tm2rv$stage_id

barplot(t(rv_put_together), beside=T, ylab = "Relative rep value", xlab = "Stage",
  ylim = c(0, 1.3), col = c("black", "orangered", "grey", "darkred"), bty = "n")
legend("topleft", c("det ahist", "det hist", "sto ahist", "sto hist"),
  col = c("black", "orangered", "grey", "darkred"), pch = 15, bty = "n")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We see some big differences here. In the deterministic analyses, the historical case predicts a greater importance of small and medium-sized flowering adults, and a lower importance of all other stages than the ahistorical case. In the stochastic analyses, the highest reproductive values are in the largest flowering adults, though large non-flowering and medium-sized adults have reproductive values almost as high. So, both history and temporal stochasticity have large effects here. Interesting results in need of further study!</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Let's now do a sensitivity analysis, again using both deterministic and stochastic approaches. First we will look at the ahistorical MPM.</p>
```{r Ch5.22}
tm2sens <- sensitivity3(tmeans2r)
set.seed(42)
tm2sens_s <- sensitivity3(cypmatrix2, stochastic = TRUE)

writeLines(paste0("\nThe highest deterministic sensitivity value: ",
  max(tm2sens$ah_sensmats[[1]][which(tmeans2r$A[[1]] > 0)])))
writeLines(paste0("This value is associated with element: ",

```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The highest sensitivity value in both cases appears to be associated with the transition from 1-sprouted non-flowering adult to the largest flowering adult (element 378, in the 7th column and 54th row). Inspecting each sensitivity matrix also shows that transitions near that element in both matrices are also associated with rather high sensitivities.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's compare with the historical case. We will compare both the full historical sensitivity matrices, and also look at the historically-corrected deterministic sensitivities.</p>

```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Here, we see both deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analyses supporting the transition from 1-sprouted non-flowering adult in occasions *t*-1 and *t* to the largest flowering adult in occasion *t*+1 (we can see this by dividing 962,658 by the number of stage pairs, which is 2916 - rounding up the answer gives us the matrix column [331], and the remainder from this division problem gives us the row [378]; the row and column numbers can then be checked against the `hstages` portion of the historical `lefkoMat` object used as input). The highest historically-corrected deterministic sensitivity value is associated with the transition from 1-sprouted non-flowering adult to 20-sprouted flowering adults (element 374), while the historically-corrected stochastic sensitivity value is associated with the transitions from 1-sprouted non-flowering adult to the largest flowering adult stage (element 378). Thus, our results generally reinforce the results of the ahistorical case.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Let's now assess the elasticity of $\lambda$ to matrix elements, comparing the ahistorical to the historically-corrected case in both deterministic and stochastic analyses.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Ahistorical and historical, deterministic and stochastic analyses suggest that population growth rate is most elastic in response to stasis as 1-sprouted non-flowering adult (element 331). Indeed, element 962,611 in the historical case is actually stasis in this stage across times *t*-1, *t*, and *t*+1 (column: `round(962611/2916) = 331`; row: `962611 %% 2916 = 331`). This is a remarkably consistent result, reinforcing the importance of this stage as seen in sensitivity analyses.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Elasticity analyses in these plots look fairly similar. Population growth rates are most elastic in response to changes in stage 7, which is the one-sprouted non-flowering adult stage. Generally speaking, small adult stages have the highest elasticity. Most of the differences between analyses here appear to lie in elasticity of small non-flowering vs. flowering adults in the ahistorical vs. historical comparison.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, let's take a look at how the importance of different kinds of transitions changes, by looking at elasticity sums. The plot will show that population growth rates are most elastic in response to changes in growth and shrinkage, with virtually no influence of fecundity.</p>
