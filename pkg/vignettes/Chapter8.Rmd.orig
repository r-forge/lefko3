  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In this vignette, we use the `lathyrus` dataset to illustrate the estimation of **age-by-stage function-based MPMs**. These are inherently ahistorical MPMs, and so we do not include historical analyses in this vignette. To reduce output size, we have prevented some statements from running if they produce long stretches of output. Examples include most `summary()` calls. Remove the hashtags to run these calls. This vignette is only a sample analysis. Detailed information and instructions on using `lefko3` are available through a free online e-book called *lefko3: a gentle introduction*, available on <a href = "http://www.sheffersonlab.com/projects">the projects page</a> of the Shefferson lab website. </p>
  
### ORGANISM AND POPULATION 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">*Lathyrus vernus* (family Fabaceae) is a long-lived forest herb, native to Europe and large parts of northern Asia. Individuals increase slowly in size and usually flower only after 10-15 years of vegetative growth. Flowering individuals have an average conditional lifespan of 44.3 years [@ehrlen_how_2002]. *L. vernus* lacks organs for vegetative spread and individuals are well delimited [@ehrlen_assessing_2002]. One or several erect shoots of up to 40 cm height emerge from a subterranean rhizome in March-April. Flowering occurs about four weeks after shoot emergence. Shoot growth is determinate, and the number of flowers is determined in the previous year [@ehrlen_storage_2001]. Individuals may not produce aboveground structures every year, but can remain dormant in one or more seasons. *L. vernus* is self-compatible but requires visits from bumble-bees to produce seeds. Individuals produce few, large seeds and establishment from seeds is relatively frequent [@ehrlen_seedling_1996]. The pre-dispersal seed predator *Bruchus atomarius* often consumes a large fraction of developing seeds, and roe deer (*Capreolus capreolus*) sometimes consume the shoots [@ehrlen_timing_2009].</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Data for this study were collected from six permanent plots in a population of *L. vernus* located in a deciduous forest in the Tullgarn area, SE Sweden (58.9496 N, 17.6097 E), during 1988–1991 [@ehrlen_demography_1995]. The six plots were similar with regard to soil type, elevation, slope, and canopy cover. Within each plot, all individuals were marked with numbered tags that remained over the study period, and their locations were carefully mapped. New individuals were included in the study in each year. Individuals were recorded at least three times every growth season. At the time of shoot emergence, we recorded whether individuals were alive and produced above-ground shoots, and if shoots had been grazed. During flowering, we recorded flower number and the height and diameter of all shoots. At fruit maturation, we counted the number of intact and damaged seeds. To derive a measure of above-ground size for each individual, we calculated the volume of each shoot as $\pi × (\frac{1}{2} diameter)^2 × height$, and summed the volumes of all shoots. This measure is closely correlated with the dry mass of aboveground tissues ($R^2 = 0.924$, $P < 0.001$, $n = 50$, log-transformed values; Ehrlén 1995). Size of individuals that had been grazed was estimated based on measures of shoot diameter in grazed shoots, and the relationship between shoot diameter and shoot height in non-grazed individuals. Only individuals with an aboveground volume of more than 230 mm<sup>3</sup> flowered and produced fruits during this study. Individuals that lacked aboveground structures in one season but reappeared in the following year were considered dormant. Individuals that lacked aboveground structures in two subsequent seasons were considered dead from the year in which they first lacked aboveground structures. Probabilities of seeds surviving to the next year, and of being present as seedlings or seeds in the soil seed bank, were derived from separate yearly sowing experiments in separate plots adjacent to each subplot [@ehrlen_seedling_1996].</p>
  
### BASIC WORKFLOW  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The dataset that we have provided is organized in horizontal format, meaning that each row holds all of the data for a single, unique individual, and columns correspond to individual condition in particular monitoring occasions (which we refer to as *years* here, since there was one main census in each year). The original spreadsheet file used to keep the dataset has a repeating pattern to these columns, with each year having a similarly arranged group of variables. Package `lefko3` includes functions to handle data in horizontal format, as well as vertically formatted data (i.e. data for individuals is broken up across rows, where each row is a unique combination of individual and year in occasion *t*). Let's load the dataset.</p>
```{r Ch8.0}
data(lathyrus)
dim(lathyrus)
#summary(lathyrus)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">This dataset includes information on 1,119 individuals, so there are 1,119 rows with data (not counting the header). There are 38 columns. The first two columns are variables identifying each individual (`SUBPLOT` refers to the patch, and `GENET` refers to individual identity), with each individual's data entirely restricted to one row. This is followed by four sets of nine columns, each named `VolumeXX`, `lnVolXX`, `FCODEXX`, `FlowXX`, `IntactseedXX`, `Dead19XX`, `DormantXX`, `Missing19XX`, and `SeedlingXX`, where `XX` corresponds to the year of observation and with years organized consecutively. Thus, columns 3-11 refer to year 1988, columns 12-20 refer to year 1989, etc. This strictly repeated pattern allows us to manipulate the original dataset quickly and efficiently via `lefko3`. There are four years of data - 1988 to 1991. Our data columns are also arranged in the same order for each year, with years in consecutive order with no extra columns between them. Note that this order is not required, but it makes life easier because following a strictly repeating pattern allows us to skip inputting the names or numbers of each column of data directly later during demographic data formatting.</p>
  
#### Step 1. Life history model development
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">To begin, we will create a **stageframe** for this dataset. A stageframe is a data frame that describes all stages in the life history of the organism, in a way usable by the functions in this package and using stage names and classifications that completely match those used in the dataset. It links the dataset and our analyses to our life history model. In this case, the life history model is a life cycle graph (Figure 8.1). This model is based on the life history model provided in @ehrlen_dynamics_2000, but we utilize a different size classification based on the log leaf volume to make the size distribution more closely match a symmetric and somewhat normal distribution.</p>
  
<img src = "lathfun3.png" width = "700"></img>  
  
Figure 8.1. Life history model of *Lathyrus vernus* using the log leaf volume as the size classification metric.
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Our stageframe needs to include complete descriptions of all stages that occur in the dataset and in the life history model, with each stage defined uniquely. Since this object can be used for automated classification of individuals, all sizes, reproductive states, and other characteristics defining each stage in the dataset need to be accounted for explicitly. Great care must be taken to include all size values and values of other descriptor variables occurring within the dataset, without including erroneous outliers. The final description of each stage occurring in the dataset must not completely overlap with any other stage also found in the dataset, although partial overlap is allowed and expected.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Before creating the stageframe, let's explore the possible size variables. We will particularly look at summaries of the distribution of original and log sizes. Size here is given as leaf volume, and because this metric may have allometric relationships to vital rates, we will also look at log size.</p>
```{r Ch8.1}
summary(c(lathyrus$Volume88, lathyrus$Volume89, lathyrus$Volume90, lathyrus$Volume91))
summary(c(lathyrus$lnVol88, lathyrus$lnVol89, lathyrus$lnVol90, lathyrus$lnVol91))
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The upper summary shows the original size, while the lower line shows the size given in logarithmic terms. We should note the size minima and maxima, because we have been using 0 as the size of vegetatively dormant individuals. The lowest uncorrected size is 1.8, with a maximum of 7032. The minimum corrected size is 0.6, and the maximum corrected size is 8.9. Since the minimum corrected size is positive, and since the number of NAs has not increased (increased NAs would suggest that some unusable log sizes occur in the dataset), we are still able to use the log size value 0 as an indicator of vegetative dormancy. Note, however, that vegetative dormancy is currently included in the many NAs that occur in size variables in this dataset.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">It can also help to take a look at plots of these distributions. We will plot raw and log volume.</p>
```{r Ch8.2, fig.cap = "Figure 8.2. Density plot of aboveground plant volume"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(density(c(lathyrus$Volume88, lathyrus$Volume89, lathyrus$Volume90,
    lathyrus$Volume91), na.rm = TRUE), main = "", xlab = "Volume", bty = "n")
plot(density(c(lathyrus$lnVol88, lathyrus$lnVol89, lathyrus$lnVol90,
    lathyrus$lnVol91), na.rm = TRUE), main = "", xlab = "Log volume", bty = "n")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Note how highly skewed the raw volume distribution is. This might cause some difficulty if we used raw size untransformed and with a Gaussian distribution. Certainly, a Gamma distribution would be perfectly justified, and users are urged to try that approach. We will use the log volume here, which looks 'better' than the raw volume distribution in the sense that it is closer to some semblance of a Gaussian distribution, mostly through an increased level of symmetry. We can then assume that log volume is Gaussian-distributed and that the mean bears no relationship to the variance.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We will now develop a stageframe that incorporates the log volume of size. We will build this with vectors of the values describing each stage, always in the same order.</p>
```{r Ch8.3}
sizevector <- c(0, 4.6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
stagevector <- c("Sd", "Sdl", "Dorm", "Sz1nr", "Sz2nr", "Sz3nr", "Sz4nr",
  "Sz5nr","Sz6nr", "Sz7nr", "Sz8nr", "Sz9nr", "Sz1r", "Sz2r", "Sz3r", "Sz4r",
  "Sz5r", "Sz6r", "Sz7r", "Sz8r", "Sz9r")
repvector <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
obsvector <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
matvector <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
immvector <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
propvector <- c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
indataset <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
binvec <- c(0, 4.6, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 
            0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
minima <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
maxima <- c(NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,
  NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
comments <- c("Dormant seed", "Seedling", "Dormant", "Size 1 Veg", "Size 2 Veg",
  "Size 3 Veg", "Size 4 Veg", "Size 5 Veg", "Size 6 Veg", "Size 7 Veg",
  "Size 8 Veg", "Size 9 Veg", "Size 1 Flo", "Size 2 Flo", "Size 3 Flo",
  "Size 4 Flo", "Size 5 Flo", "Size 6 Flo", "Size 7 Flo", "Size 8 Flo",
  "Size 9 Flo")
lathframeln <- sf_create(sizes = sizevector, stagenames = stagevector,
  repstatus = repvector, obsstatus = obsvector, propstatus = propvector, 
  immstatus = immvector, matstatus = matvector, indataset = indataset,
  binhalfwidth = binvec, minage = minima, maxage = maxima, comments = comments)
#lathframeln
```
  
#### Step 2a. Data standardization
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Once the stageframe is created, we can standardize the dataset into historically-formatted vertical (*hfv*) format. Here, we will use the `verticalize3()` function, which creates historically-formatted vertical datasets from horizontally structured raw data, as below. We will also replace NAs in size and fecundity variables with zeros for `modelsearch` to work properly when we build models of vital rates, so we will now set `NAas0 = TRUE`. Some care needs to be taken with this last step, since some authors give missing values extra meaning not present in a value of zero. In our case, a missing value indicates that a plant was dead (both size and fecundity are missing), was alive but not sprouting (size was missing), or was alive but did not produce seed (fecundity was missing). In all cases, these NA values may be replaced by 0, because other variables indicate those conditions.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We also have two choices for use as our reproductive status and fecundity variables. The first choice, `FCODE88` indicates whether a plant flowered. The second choice, `Intactseed88`, indicates the number of seed produced. Flowering plants typically have different demographic characteristics than non-flowering plants, either reflecting reproductive costs, or, conversely, because flowering plants might have more resources and hence higher survival than non-flowering plants. We should separate transitions among these two groups. So, let's use `FCODE88` to indicate reproductive status, and `Intactseed88` to indicate fecundity.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Finally, note that in the input to the following function, we utilize a strictly repeating pattern of variable names arranged in the same order for each monitoring occasion. This arrangement allows us to enter only the first variable in each set, as long as `noyears` and `blocksize` are set properly and no gaps or shuffles appear in the dataset. The data management functions that we have created for `lefko3` do not require such repeating patterns, but they do make the required input in the function much shorter and more succinct. To see a detailed summary of the resulting hfv dataset, remove `full = FALSE` from the `summary_hfv()` call. Note that prior to standardizing the dataset, we will create a new variable to code individual identity, since different plants in different subpopulations use the same identifiers.</p>
```{r Ch8.4}
lathyrus$indiv_id <- paste(lathyrus$SUBPLOT, lathyrus$GENET)

lathvertln <- verticalize3(lathyrus, noyears = 4, firstyear = 1988,
  patchidcol = "SUBPLOT", individcol = "indiv_id", blocksize = 9,
  juvcol = "Seedling1988", sizeacol = "lnVol88", repstracol = "FCODE88",
  fecacol = "Intactseed88", deadacol = "Dead1988",
  nonobsacol = "Dormant1988", stageassign = lathframeln,
  stagesize = "sizea", censorcol = "Missing1988", censorkeep = NA,
  NAas0 = TRUE, censorRepeat = TRUE, censor = TRUE)

summary_hfv(lathvertln, full = FALSE)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Before we move on to the next key steps in analysis, let's take a closer look at fecundity. In this dataset, fecundity is mostly a count of intact seeds, and only differs in six cases where the seed output was estimated based on other models. To see this, try the following code.</p>
```{r Ch8.5}
# Length of fecundity vaiable in t:
length(lathvertln$feca2)
# Number of non-integer entries:
length(which(lathvertln$feca2 != round(lathvertln$feca2)))
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We see that we have quite a bit of fecundity data, and that it is overwhelmingly but not exclusively composed of integer values. The six non-integer values force us to make a decision - should we treat fecundity as a continuous variable, or round the values and treat it as a count variable? Here, we will round fecundity so that we can treat fecundity as a count variable in the analysis.</p>
```{r Ch8.6}
lathvertln$feca3 <- round(lathvertln$feca3)
lathvertln$feca2 <- round(lathvertln$feca2)
lathvertln$feca1 <- round(lathvertln$feca1)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Fecundity is an integer variable, allowing us to use a count-based distribution. `lefko3` currently allows six choices of count distributions: Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, zero-inflated negative binomial, zero-truncated Poisson, and zero-truncated negative binomial. To assess which to use, we should first assess whether the mean and variance of the count are equal using a dispersion test. This test allows us to test whether the variance is greater than that expected under our mean value for fecundity using a chi-squared test. If it is not significantly different, then we may use some variant of the Poisson distribution. If the data are overdispersed, then we should use the negative binomial distribution. We should also test whether the number of zeroes is more than expected under these distributions, and make the distribution zero-inflated if so. Note that, because we have not excluded zeros from fecundity using reproductive status, we should not use a zero-truncated distribution.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We will use the `hfv_qc()` function to assess the quality of the data and decide on the correct distributions. We will use most of the input from the `modelsearch()` call that we will conduct later.</p>
```{r Ch8.7}
hfv_qc(data = lathvertln, vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec"),
  juvestimate = "Sdl", indiv = "individ", year = "year2", age = "obsage")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">All of the probability variables look like binomials, so we have no problem there. Size and juvenile size appear to be continuous variables that differ significantly from the assumptions of the Gaussian distribution. However, we will still use a Gaussian distribution in this case, for instructional purposes. Fecundity is a count variable with significant overdispersion and significantly more zeros than expected, so we should use a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution.</p>
  
#### Step 2b. Provide supplemental information for matrix estimation  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Matrix estimation functions in package `lefko3` are made to work with **supplement tables**, which provide extra data for matrix estimation that is not included in the main demographic dataset. The `supplemental()` function provides a means of incorporating four additional kinds of data into MPM construction:</p>
  
  1. fixed transition values derived from other studies and added as constants to matrices,
  2. proxy transition values when data for particular transitions do not exist and other, estimable transitions need to be used as proxies,
  3. reproductive multipliers indicating which stages lead to the production of which stages, and at what level relative to estimated fecundity, as well as multipliers for proxy transitions, and
  4. survival multipliers, in cases in which proxy survival transitions are used but must be set at elevated or reduced levels relative to the original transition.
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Here, we will create an ahistorical supplemental table organizing some of these sorts of data. Each row refers to a specific transition. The first two of these transitions are set to specific probabilities, which are the probabilities of germination and seed dormancy, estimated from a separate study. The final two terms are fecundity multipliers, which mark which transitions correspond to fecundity and provide information on what multiple of fecundity estimated via linear modeling applies to each case. Note that `type = 3` multipliers cannot be age-specific, while fecundity multipliers incorporated as `type = 2` may be set to specific ages.</p>
```{r Ch8.8}
lathsupp2 <- supplemental(stage3 = c("Sd", "Sdl", "Sd", "Sdl"), 
  stage2 = c("Sd", "Sd", "rep", "rep"),
  givenrate = c(0.345, 0.054, NA, NA),
  multiplier = c(NA, NA, 0.345, 0.054),
  type = c(1, 1, 3, 3), stageframe = lathframeln, historical = FALSE)
#lathsupp2
```
  
#### Step 3. Tests of history, and vital rate modeling  
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Next we will run the `modelsearch` function with the new vertical dataset. This function will develop our best-fit vital rate models for us. We provide descriptions of this function in the documentation, in some of the other vignettes, and in *lefko3: a gentle introduction*. Please see those materials for further information.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Here, we will create two ahistorical model sets. The first will be a model set for the entire population, without separating patches. The second will include patch as a random factor, and will thus allow us to explore patch dynamics as well as population dynamics. We will not create a historical set this time because we are producing an age x stage MPM only - `lefko3` does not currently estimate or support historical age x stage MPMs.</p>
```{r Ch8.9}
lathmodelsln2 <- modelsearch(lathvertln, historical = FALSE,
  approach = "mixed", suite = "main",
  vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec"), juvestimate = "Sdl",
  bestfit = "AICc&k", sizedist = "gaussian", fecdist = "negbin",
  indiv = "individ", year = "year2", age = "obsage", year.as.random = TRUE,
  patch.as.random = TRUE, show.model.tables = TRUE, fec.zero = TRUE,
  quiet = "partial")
lathmodelsln2p <- modelsearch(lathvertln, historical = FALSE,
  approach = "mixed", suite = "main",
  vitalrates = c("surv", "obs", "size", "repst", "fec"), juvestimate = "Sdl",
  bestfit = "AICc&k", sizedist = "gaussian", fecdist = "negbin",
  indiv = "individ", patch = "patchid", year = "year2", age = "obsage",
  year.as.random = TRUE, patch.as.random = TRUE, show.model.tables = TRUE,
  fec.zero = TRUE, quiet = "partial")

#summary(lathmodelsln2)
#summary(lathmodelsln2p)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The output can be rather verbose, and so we have limited it with `quiet = "partial"`. The function was developed to provide text marker posts of what the function is doing and what it has accomplished, as well as to show all warnings from all workhorse functions used. Because we used the `mixed` approach here, this includes warnings originating from estimating mixed linear models with package `lme4` [@bates_fitting_2015] and, in the case of fecundity, the package `glmmTMB` [@brooks_glmmtmb_2017]. It also shows warnings originating from the `dredge()` function of package `MuMIn` [@barton_mumin_2014], which is the core function used in model building and AICc estimation. We encourage users to get familiar with interpreting these warnings and assessing the degree to which they impact their own analyses.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In developing these linear models, the `modelsearch()` function created a series of nested datasets to estimate vital rates as conditional rates and probabilities. The exact subsets created depend on which parameters were called for. It is important to consider which are required, and particular attention needs to be paid if there are size classes with sizes of 0. In these situations, it is best to consider a size of 0 as unobservable, and so to introduce observation status as a vital rate to absorb these sizes. This sets up datasets for size estimation that do not include 0 in the response term, because all 0 responses are already absorbed by observation status.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">A look at the summaries shows that the best-fit models vary in complexity. Age is important in three of the adult vital rates, in both the population-only model set as well as the patch model set. For example, survival is influenced by reproductive status and age in the current year, as well as by patch, individual identity, and year, while observation status is not influenced by age. We can see these models explicitly, as well as the model tables developed, by calling them directly from the lefkoMod object. The accuracy of many of our models is high, but some are mid-range and juvenile size is abysmally low, meaning that it is likely that we have not included some important factors accounting for variability in at least some of our vital rates.</p>
  
#### Step 4. MPM estimation 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Next, we will estimate the ahistorical sets of matrices. We will match the ahistorical age-by-stage matrix estimation function, `aflefko2()`, with the appropriate ahistorical input, including the ahistorical lefkoMod objects `lathmodelsln2` and `lathmodelsln2p`. Model sets that include historical terms should not be used to create ahistorical matrices, since the coefficients in the best-fit models are estimated assuming a specific model structure that either relies on historical terms or does not. Historical vital rate models may yield biased results if used to construct ahistorical matrices. Also note that `lefko3` does not currently allow the construction of historical age-by-stage MPMs. We will assume a prebreeding model, and set the maximum age to 3, per our dataset, but note that individuals may move past this age with `continue = TRUE`.</p>
```{r Ch8.10}
lathmat2age <- aflefko2(year = "all", stageframe = lathframeln,
  modelsuite = lathmodelsln2, data = lathvertln, supplement = lathsupp2,
  final_age = 3, continue = TRUE, reduce = FALSE)
lathmat2agep <- aflefko2(year = "all", patch = "all", stageframe = lathframeln,
  modelsuite = lathmodelsln2p, data = lathvertln, supplement = lathsupp2,
  final_age = 3, continue = TRUE, reduce = FALSE)

#summary(lathmat2age)
#summary(lathmat2agep)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The first model set led to the development of three matrices, reflecting the four years of data. The second model set led to the development of 18 matrices, reflecting four years and six patches. The quality control section gives us a sense of the amount of data used to model each vital rate, and also shows us that the survival-transition (`U`) matrices are composed entirely of proper probabilities yielding stage survival probability falling between 0.0 and 1.0. Matrix estimation protocols can sometimes create spurious values, such as stage survival greater than 1.0. Such values can occur for a variety of reasons, but the most common is the inclusion through a supplement table of externally-determined survival probabilities that are too high. Make sure to check your matrix column sums each time you estimate MPMs to prevent this problem. Survival greater than 1.0 can lead to strange effects on metrics of population dynamics.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We can get a sense of what these matrices look like by visualizing them. Let's use the `image3()` function to look at the first one.</p>
```{r Ch8.11, fig.cap = "Figure 8.4. Visualization of 1st A Matrix"}
image3(lathmat2age, used = 1)
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The clear squares refer to zero elements, and the red elements refer to non-zero values corresponding to survival transitions and fecundity. The vast number of zeros may be surprising, but this matrix is a supermatrix organized by age first, with stage organizing within-age blocks. The first age is age 0, which cannot be adult, and age 1 corresponds to seedlings, leading to most non-zero elements in the adult portion. The adult block occurs from age 2, and this block can perpetuate indefinitely. The number of elements estimated is greater now than in the typical ahistorical MPM, because now we have added age as a major factor for analysis. This matrix is overwhelmingly composed of elements that must be 0, and so it is a rather sparse matrix ((1070.67 + 54)  / 3969 = 28.3% of elements).</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We can view the order of ages and stages using the `agestages` element of the lefkoMat object we produced, as below. Note that our matrix is 63 rows by 63 columns, and this object gives us the exact order used.</p>
```{r Ch8.12}
#lathmat2age$agestages
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's estimate the element-wise arithmetic mean matrices. The first `lefkoMat` object created will include a single mean matrix, while the second will include six patch-level mean matrices followed by a grand mean matrix, yielding seven matrices (remember to look at the `labels` element of the output to see the exact order of matrices).</p>
```{r Ch8.13}
lathmat2mean <- lmean(lathmat2age)
lathmat2pmean <- lmean(lathmat2agep)

#summary(lathmat2pmean)
```
  
#### Step 5. MPM analysis 
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's estimate the deterministic population growth rate $\lambda$, and the stochastic population growth rate, $a = \text{log} \lambda _{S}$, in our age x stage MPM. We'll plot them for comparison, making sure to take the natural exponent of the stochastic growth rate to make it comparable to $\lambda$. We will show the patch means and the grand population mean.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Deterministic and stochastic analyses suggest that the population and all patches are declining, with all years and patches associated with $\lambda < 1$ and $a = \text{log} \lambda _{S} < 0$. Qualitatively, they agree with the $\lambda$ and $a = \text{log} \lambda _{S}$ estimates from our other *Lathyrus* vignettes.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Now let's look at the stable stage distribution, using the population matrices rather than the patch matrices. The output for the ahistorical MPM is a data frame with matrix of origin, stage name, and stable stage proportion in each row. Because the default output for the `stablestage3()` function will give us the stable distribution of age-stages, we will collapse the output across age to produce a true stable stage distribution.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We will next assess to which matrix elements $\lambda$ and $\lambda_S$ are most sensitive to changes in via deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analysis.</p>
```{r Ch8.17}

```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The highest deterministic value appears to be associated with the transition from flowering size 6 adults in age 3 or higher to dormant adult (element 3762, in column 45, row 60). The stochastic sensitivity analysis suggests element 3888, which is associated with the transition from three year old flowering size 8 adults to dormant adult (column 62, row 45). Inspecting the sensitivity matrix (type `lathmat2msens$ah_sensmats[[1]]` to view the full deterministic sensitivity matrix, or `lathmat2msens_s$ah_sensmats[[1]]` to view the full stochastic sensitivity matrix) also shows that transitions near these elements are associated with rather high sensitivities.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Let's now assess the elasticity of $\lambda$ or $\lambda_S$ to matrix elements.</p>
```{r Ch8.18}

# The largest stochastic elasticity is associated with element:

```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The deterministic analysis shows the highest elasticity associated with element 3201 (col 51, row 51, stasis as a size 6 non-reproductive 3yr old or older adult), while the stochastic analysis show that population growth rate is most elastic to element 3905, which is in column 62 and row 62 (transition from three year old or older size 8 reproductive adult to the same stage).</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Elasticity values can be treated as additive and sum to 1.0 within single matrices. This allows us to make interesting comparisons, such as to compare the elasticity of population growth rate to changes in transitions associated with specific stages. Let's conduct such an analysis, and plot the results.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We see in the analysis above that in both the deterministic and stochastic cases, the population growth rate is most elastic to changes associated with flowering and non-flowering mid-sized adults, and to some extent with vegetatively dormant adults, in the highest ages. Juvenile stages and dormant seeds have little influence. However, stochastic analysis suggests a greater importance of larger reproductive adults than deterministic analysis does.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">Our estimated elasticities can also be summarized by transition type. Let's take a look at a plot, using the `summary.lefkoElas()` function to help us assess these transition types.</p>
```{r Ch8.20, fig.cap = "Figure 8.9. Elasticities by transition type"}

legend("topright", c("deterministic", "stochastic"), col = c("black", "orangered"),
  pch = 15, bty = "n")
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">We see in the plot above that deterministic and stochastic analyses agree strongly about the importance and influence of transition types to population growth rate. Specifically, the population growth rate is most strongly elastic in response to changes in growth transitions, and almost completely inelastic to changes in fecundity. Shrinkage is almost as influential as growth, and stasis is almost as important in stochastic analysis.</p>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">In addition to sensitivity and elasticity analyses, we can use package `lefko3` to assess the actual impacts of demographic shifts or differences on the population growth rate. Two tools for this purpose are the life table response experiment (LTRE), and its stochastic version the stochastic life table response experiment (sLTRE). Both are available via the `ltre3()` function. Below, we perform a standard deterministic LTRE to assess the impact of space on the population growth rate. This is done via a comparison of patch-level demography to the grand mean matrix, which is the default comparison if no reference matrices are provided. Remove the hashtag from the second line to see the full structure of the resulting object. Particularly, you will notice that the first element, `ltre_det`, is a list of six matrices. These matrices show the actual impact of the difference in elements between the respective patch-level matrix and the reference matrix (here, the grand population mean matrix) on the population growth rate $\lambda$. After this, we see similar structure to the input `lefkoMat` object, including the stageframe and order of matrices.</p>
```{r Ch8.21}
lathmat2m_ltre <- ltre3(lathmat2pmean)
#lathmat2m_ltre
```
  
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">The sLTRE produces output that is a bit different. Here, we see two lists of matrices prior to the MPM metadata. The first, `ltre_mean`, is a list of matrices showing the impact of differences in mean elements between the patch-level temporal mean matrices and the reference temporal mean matrix. The second, `ltre_sd`, is a list of matrices showing the impact of differences in the temporal standard deviation of each element between the patch-level and reference matrix sets. In other words, while a standard LTRE shows the impact of changes in matrix elements on $\lambda$, the sLTRE shows the impacts of changes in the mean and the variability of matrix elements on $\text{log} \lambda$.</p>
