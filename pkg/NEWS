-------------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES
    1. Function projection3() now includes the ability to produce replicate
       simulations.
    2. Function summary.lefkoProj() created to summarize the results of

    1. Sensitivity and elasticity descriptions corrected in vignettes.
    
  BUG FIXES
    1. Fixed issue that could lead rlefko2() and rlefko3() to stop processing
       matrices if specific years or patches are called.
    2. Fixed issue affecting stochastic reproductive value estimation in
       historical lefkoMat objects.
    3. Fixed issue affecting some deterministic reproductive value estimates,
       particularly in large historical MPMs, where a base reference value for
